<h1><a name = "Pref">PREFACE</a></h1>
<p>The following brief sketch is an attempt to present, in a popular
form, the history of our English dialects, from the eighth century to
the present day. The evidence, which is necessarily somewhat
imperfect, goes to show that the older dialects appear to have been
few in number, each being tolerably uniform over a wide area; and that
the rather numerous dialects of the present day were gradually
developed by the breaking up of the older groups into subdialects.
This is especially true of the old Northumbrian dialect, in which the
speech of Aberdeen was hardly distinguishable from that of Yorkshire,
down to the end of the fourteenth century; soon after which date, the
use of it for literary purposes survived in Scotland only. The chief
literary dialect, in the earliest period, was Northumbrian or
“Anglian,” down to the middle of the ninth century. After that time
our literature was mostly in the Southern or Wessex dialect, commonly
called “Anglo-Saxon,” the dominion of which lasted down to the early
years of the thirteenth <a name = "pagevi"> </a><span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
century, when the East Midland dialect
surely but gradually rose to pre-eminence, and has now become the
speech of the empire. Towards this result the two great universities
contributed not a little. I proceed to discuss the foreign elements
found in our dialects, the chief being Scandinavian and French. The
influence of the former has long been acknowledged; a due recognition
of the importance of the latter has yet to come. In conclusion, I give
some selected specimens of the use of the modern dialects.</p>

<p>I beg leave to thank my friend Mr P. Giles, M.A., Hon. LL.D. of
Aberdeen, and University Reader in Comparative Philology, for a few
hints and for kindly advice.</p>

<h2>DIALECTS AND THEIR VALUE</h2>

<p>According to the New English Dictionary, the oldest sense, in English,
of the word <i>dialect</i> was simply “a manner of speaking” or
“phraseology,” in accordance with its derivation from the Greek
<i>dialectos</i>, a discourse or way of speaking; from the verb
<i>dialegesthai</i>, to discourse or converse.</p>

<p>The modern meaning is somewhat more precise. In relation to a language
such as English, it is used in a special sense to signify “a local
variety of speech differing from the standard or literary language.”
When we talk of “speakers of dialect,” we imply that they employ a
provincial method of speech to which the man who has been educated to
use the language of books is unaccustomed. Such a man finds that the
dialect-speaker frequently uses words or modes of expression which he
does not understand or which are at any rate strange to him; and he is
sure to notice that such words as seem to be familiar to him are, for
the most part, strangely pronounced. Such differences are especially
noticeable in the use of
<a name = "page2"> </a><span class = "pagenum">2</span>
vowels and diphthongs, and in the mode
of intonation.</p>

<p>The speaker of the “standard” language is frequently tempted to
consider himself as the dialect-speaker’s superior, unless he has
already acquired some elementary knowledge of the value of the science
of language or has sufficient common sense to be desirous of learning
to understand that which for the moment lies beyond him. I remember
once hearing the remark made&mdash;“What is the good of dialects? Why not
sweep them all away, and have done with them?” But the very form of
the question betrays ignorance of the facts; for it is no more
possible to do away with them than it is possible to suppress the
waves of the sea. English, like every other literary language, has
always had its dialects and will long continue to possess them in
secluded districts, though they are at the present time losing much of
that archaic character which gives them their chief value. The spread
of education may profoundly modify them, but the spoken language of
the people will ever continue to devise new variations and to initiate
developments of its own. Even the “standard” language is continually
losing old words and admitting new ones, as was noted long ago by
Horace; and our so-called “standard” pronunciation is ever
imperceptibly but surely changing, and never continues in one stay.</p>

<a name = "page3"> </a><span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<p>In the very valuable <i>Lectures on the Science of Language</i>
by Professor F. Max Müller, the second Lecture, which deserves careful
study, is chiefly occupied by some account of the processes which he
names respectively “phonetic decay” and “dialectic regeneration”;
processes to which all languages have always been and ever will be
subject.</p>

<p>By “phonetic decay” is meant that insidious and gradual alteration in
the sounds of spoken words which, though it cannot be prevented, at
last so corrupts a word that it becomes almost or wholly unmeaning.
Such a word as <i>twenty</i> does not suggest its origin. Many might
perhaps guess, from their observation of such numbers as <i>thirty,
forty</i>, etc., that the suffix <i>-ty</i> may have something to do
with <i>ten</i>, of the original of which it is in fact an extremely
reduced form; but it is less obvious that <i>twen-</i> is a shortened
form of <i>twain</i>. And perhaps none but scholars of Teutonic
languages are aware that <i>twain</i> was once of the masculine gender
only, while <i>two</i> was so restricted that it could only be applied
to things that were feminine or neuter. As a somewhat hackneyed
example of phonetic decay, we may take the case of the Latin <i>mea
domina</i>, i.e. my mistress, which became in French <i>ma dame</i>,
and in English <i>madam</i>; and the last of these has been further
shortened to <i>mam</i>, and even to <i>’m</i>, as in the phrase “Yes,
’m.” This shows how nine letters may be
<a name = "page4"> </a><span class = "pagenum">4</span>
reduced to one.
Similarly, our monosyllable <i>alms</i> is all that is left of the
Greek <i>eleēmosynē</i>. Ten letters have here been reduced to
four.</p>

<p>This irresistible tendency to indistinctness and loss is not, however,
wholly bad; for it has at the same time largely contributed,
especially in English, to such a simplification of grammatical
inflexions as certainly has the practical convenience of giving us
less to learn. But in addition to this decay in the forms of words, we
have also to reckon with a depreciation or weakening of the ideas they
express. Many words become so hackneyed as to be no longer impressive.
As late as in 1820, Keats could say, in stanza 6 of his poem of
<i>Isabella</i>, that “His heart beat awfully against his side”; but
at the present day the word <i>awfully</i> is suggestive of
schoolboys’ slang. It is here that we may well have the benefit of the
principle of “dialectic regeneration.” We shall often do well to
borrow from our dialects many terms that are still fresh and racy, and
instinct with a full significance. Tennyson was well aware of this,
and not only wrote several poems wholly in the Lincolnshire dialect,
but introduced dialect words elsewhere. Thus in <i>The Voyage of
Maeldune</i>, he has the striking line: “Our voices were thinner and
fainter than any flittermouse-shriek.” In at least sixteen dialects a
<i>flittermouse</i> means “a bat.”</p>

<p>I have mentioned Tennyson in this connexion
<a name = "page5"> </a><span class = "pagenum">5</span>
because he was a
careful student of English, not only in its dialectal but also in its
older forms. But, as a matter of fact, nearly all our chief writers
have recognised the value of dialectal words. Tennyson was not the
first to use the above word. Near the end of the Second Act of his
<i>Sad Shepherd</i>, Ben Jonson speaks of:</p>

<div class = "verse1">Green-bellied snakes, blue fire-drakes in the sky,<br>
And giddy flitter-mice with leather wings.</div>

<p>Similarly, there are plenty of “provincialisms” in Shakespeare. In an
interesting book entitled <i>Shakespeare, his Birthplace and its
Neighbourhood</i>, by J.R. Wise, there is a chapter on “The
Provincialisms of Shakespeare,” from which I beg leave to give a short
extract by way of specimen.</p>

<blockquote>
“There is the expressive compound ‘blood-boltered’ in <i>Macbeth</i>
(Act <span class = "smallcaps">iv</span>, Sc. 1), which the critics have all
thought meant simply
blood-stained. Miss Baker, in her <i>Glossary of Northamptonshire
Words</i>, first pointed out that ‘bolter’ was peculiarly a
Warwickshire word, signifying to clot, collect, or cake, as snow does
in a horse’s hoof, thus giving the phrase a far greater intensity of
meaning. And Steevens, too, first noticed that in the expression in
<i>The Winter’s Tale</i> (Act <span class = "smallcaps">iii</span>, Sc. 3), ‘Is
it a boy or a child?’&mdash;where, by the way, every actor tries to make a
point, and the audience
invariably laughs&mdash;the word ‘child’ is used, as is sometimes the case
in the midland districts, as synonymous
<a name = "page6"> </a><span class = "pagenum">6</span>
with girl; which is
plainly its meaning in this passage, although the speaker has used it
just before in its more common sense of either a boy or a girl.”
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> cites the phrase “is it
a lad or a child?” as being still current in Shropshire; and duly
states that, in Warwickshire, “dirt collected on the hairs of a
horse’s leg and forming into hard masses is said to <i>bolter</i>.”
Trench further points out that many of our pure Anglo-Saxon words
which lived on into the formation of our early English, subsequently
dropped out of our usual vocabulary, and are now to be found only in
the dialects. A good example is the word <i>eme</i>, an uncle (A.S.
<i>ēam</i>), which is rather common in Middle English, but has
seldom appeared in our literature since the tune of Drayton. Yet it is
well known in our Northern dialects, and Sir Walter Scott puts the
expression “Didna his <i>eme</i> die” in the mouth of Davie Deans
(<i>Heart of Midlothian</i>, ch. <span class = "smallcaps">xii</span>).
In fact, few things are more
extraordinary in the history of our language than the singularly
capricious manner in which good and useful words emerge into or
disappear from use in “standard” talk, for no very obvious reason.
Such a word as <i>yonder</i> is common enough still; but its
corresponding adjective <i>yon</i>, as in the phrase “yon man,” is
usually relegated to our dialects. Though it is common in Shakespeare,
it is comparatively rare in the Middle English period, from the
twelfth to the
<a name = "page7"> </a><span class = "pagenum">7</span>
fifteenth century. It only occurs once in Chaucer,
where it is introduced as being a Northern word; and it absolutely
disappears from record in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries.
Bosworth’s <i>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</i> gives no example of its use,
and it was long supposed that it would be impossible to trace it in
our early records. Nevertheless, when Dr Sweet printed, for the first
time, an edition of King Alfred’s translation of Pope Gregory’s
<i>Pastoral Care</i>, an example appeared in which it was employed in
the most natural manner, as if it were in everyday use. At p. 443 of
that treatise is the sentence&mdash;“Aris and gong to geonre byrg,” i.e.
Arise and go to yon city. Here the A.S. <i>geon</i> (pronounced like
the modern <i>yon</i>) is actually declined after the regular manner,
being duly provided with the suffix <i>-re</i>, which was the special
suffix reserved only for the genitive or dative feminine. It is here a
dative after the preposition <i>to</i>.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, no limit to the good use to which a reverent study
of our dialects may be put by a diligent student. They abound with
pearls which are worthy of a better fate than to be trampled under
foot. I will content myself with giving one last example that is
really too curious to be passed over in silence.</p>

<p>It so happens that in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem of <i>Beowulf</i>, one
of the most remarkable and precious
<a name = "page8"> </a><span class = "pagenum">8</span>
of our early poems, there is
a splendid and graphic description of a lonely mere, such as would
have delighted the heart of Edgar Allan Poe, the author of
<i>Ulalume</i>. In Professor Earle’s prose translation of this
passage, given in his <i>Deeds of Beowulf</i>, at p. 44, is a
description of two mysterious monsters, of whom it is said that “they
inhabit unvisited land, wolf-crags, windy bluffs, the dread fen-track,
where the mountain waterfall amid precipitous gloom vanisheth
beneath&mdash;flood under earth. Not far hence it is, reckoning by miles, that the
Mere standeth, and over it hang rimy groves; a wood with clenched
roots overshrouds the water.” The word to be noted here is the word
<i>rimy</i>, i.e. covered with rime or hoar-frost. The original Anglo-Saxon text
has the form <i>hrinde</i>, the meaning of which was long
doubtful. Grein, the great German scholar, writing in 1864,
acknowledged that he did not know what was intended, and it was not
till 1880 that light was first thrown upon the passage. In that year
Dr Morris edited, for the first time, some Anglo-Saxon homilies
(commonly known as the <i>Blickling Homilies</i>, because the MS. is
in the library of Blickling Hall, Norfolk); and he called attention to
a passage (at p. 209) where the homilist was obviously referring to
the lonely mere of the old poem, in which its overhanging groves were
described as being <i>hrimige</i>, which is nothing but the true old
spelling of <i>rimy</i>. He naturally concluded
<a name = "page9"> </a><span class = "pagenum">9</span>
that the word
<i>hrinde</i> (in the MS. of Beowulf) was miswritten, and that the
scribe had inadvertently put down <i>hrinde</i> instead of
<i>hrimge</i>, which is a legitimate contraction of <i>hrimige</i>.
Many scholars accepted this solution; but a further light was yet to
come, viz. in 1904. In that year, Dr Joseph Wright printed the fifth
volume of the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>, showing that in the
dialects of Scotland, Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire, the word
for “hoarfrost” is not <i>rime</i>, but <i>rind</i>, with a derived
adjective <i>rindy</i>, which has the same sense as <i>rimy</i>. At
the same time, he called attention yet once more to the passage in
<i>Beowulf</i>. It is established, accordingly, that the suspected
mistake in the MS. is no mistake at all; that the form <i>hrinde</i>
is correct, being a contraction of <i>hrindge</i> or <i>hrindige</i>,
plural of the adjective <i>hrindig</i>, which is preserved in our
dialects, in the form <i>rindy</i>, to this very day. In direct
contradiction of a common popular error that regards our dialectal
forms as being, for the most part, “corrupt,” it will be found by
experience that they are remarkably conservative and antique.</p>

<h2>DIALECTS IN EARLY TIMES</h2>

<p>The history of our dialects in the earliest periods of which we have
any record is necessarily somewhat obscure, owing to the scarcity of
the documents that have come down to us. The earliest of these have
been carefully collected and printed in one volume by Dr Sweet,
entitled <i>The Oldest English Texts</i>, edited for the Early English
Text Society in 1885. Here we already find the existence of no less
than four dialects, which have been called by the names of
Northumbrian, Mercian, Wessex (or Anglo-Saxon), and Kentish. These
correspond, respectively, though not quite exactly, to what we may
roughly call Northern, Midland, Southern, and Kentish. Whether the
limits of these dialects were always the same from the earliest times,
we cannot tell; probably not, when the unsettled state of the country
is considered, in the days when repeated invasions of the Danes and
Norsemen necessitated constant efforts to repel them. It is therefore
sufficient to define the areas
<a name = "page11"> </a><span class = "pagenum">11</span>
covered by these dialects in
quite a rough way. We may regard the Northumbrian or Northern as the
dialect or group of dialects spoken to the north of the river Humber,
as the name implies; the Wessex or Southern, as the dialect or group
of dialects spoken to the south of the river Thames; the Kentish as
being peculiar to Kent; and the Mercian as in use in the Midland
districts, chiefly to the south of the Humber and to the north of the
Thames. The modern limits are somewhat different, but the above
division of the three chief dialects (excluding Kentish) into
Northern, Midland, and Southern is sufficient for taking a broad
general view of the language in the days before the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>The investigation of the differences of dialect in our early documents
only dates from 1885, owing to the previous impossibility of obtaining
access to these oldest texts. Before that date, it so happened that
nearly all the manuscripts that had been printed or examined were in
one and the same dialect, viz. the Southern (or Wessex). The language
employed in these was (somewhat unhappily) named “Anglo-Saxon”; and
the very natural mistake was made of supposing that this “Anglo-Saxon”
was the sole language (or dialect) which served for all the “Angles”
and “Saxons” to be found in the “land of the Angles” or England. This
is the reason why it is desirable to give the more general name of
“Old English” to the
<a name = "page12"> </a><span class = "pagenum">12</span>
oldest forms of our language, because this
term can be employed collectively, so as to include Northumbrian,
Mercian, “Anglo-Saxon” and Kentish under one designation. The name
“Anglo-Saxon” was certainly rather inappropriate, as the speakers of
it were mostly Saxons and not Angles at all; which leads up to the
paradox that they did not speak “English”; for that, in the extreme
literal sense, was the language of the Angles only! But now that the
true relationship of the old dialects is known, it is not uncommon for
scholars to speak of the Wessex dialect as “Saxon,” and of the
Northumbrian and Mercian dialects as “Anglian”; for the latter are
found to have some features in common that differ sharply from those
found in “Saxon.”</p>

<p>Manuscripts in the Southern dialect are fairly abundant, and contain
poems, homilies, land-charters, laws, wills, translations of Latin
treatises, glossaries, etc.; so that there is considerable variety.
One of the most precious documents is the history known as the
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, which was continued even after the
Conquest till the year 1154, when the death and burial of King Stephen
were duly recorded.</p>

<p>But specimens of the oldest forms of the Northern and Midland dialects
are, on the other hand, very much fewer in number than students of our
language desire, and are consequently deserving of
<a name = "page13"> </a><span class = "pagenum">13</span>
special
mention. They are duly enumerated in the chapters below, which discuss
these dialects separately.</p>

<p>Having thus sketched out the broad divisions into which our dialects
may be distributed, I shall proceed to enter upon a particular
discussion of each group, beginning with the Northern or Northumbrian.</p>

<h2>THE DIALECTS OF NORTHUMBRIA; TILL A.D. 1000</h2>

<p>In Professor Earle’s excellent manual on Anglo-Saxon Literature,
chapter <span class = "smallcaps">v</span> is entirely occupied with “the
Anglian Period,” and begins
thus:&mdash;“While Canterbury was so important a seminary of learning,
there was, in the Anglian region of Northumbria, a development of
religious and intellectual life which makes it natural to regard the
whole brilliant period from the later seventh to the early ninth
century as the Anglian Period.... Anglia became for a century the
light-spot of European history; and we here recognise the first great
stage in the revival of learning, and the first movement towards the
establishment of public order in things temporal and spiritual.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the student of English, though perhaps fortunately
for the historian, the most important book belonging to this period
was written in Latin. This was the <i>Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis
Anglorum</i>, or the Church History of the Anglian
<a name = "page15"> </a><span class = "pagenum">15</span>
People. The
writer was Beda, better known as “the Venerable Bede,” who was born
near Wearmouth (Durham) in 672, and lived for the greater part of his
life at Jarrow, where he died in 735. He wrote several other works,
also in Latin, most of which Professor Earle enumerates. It is said of
Beda himself that he was “learned in our native songs,” and it is
probable that he wrote many things in his native Northumbrian or
Durham dialect; but they have all perished, with the exception of one
precious fragment of five lines, printed by Dr Sweet (at p. 149) from
the St Gall MS. No. 254, of the ninth century. It is usually called
Beda’s Death-song, and is here given:</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Fore there neidfaerae naenig uuiurthit<br>
thonc-snotturra than him thar[f] sie,<br>
to ymbhycggannae, aer his hin-iong[a]e,<br>
huaet his gastae, godaes aeththa yflaes,<br>
aefter deoth-daege doemid uueorth[a]e.
</div>

<p>Literally translated, this runs as follows:</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Before the need-journey no one becomes<br>
more wise in thought than he ought to be,<br>
(in order) to contemplate, ere his going hence,<br>
what for his spirit, (either) of good or of evil,<br>
after (his) death-day, will be adjudged.
</div>

<p>It is from Beda’s <i>Church History</i>, Book <span class = "smallcaps">iv</span>,
chap. 24 (or 22),
that we learn the story of Cædmon, the famous Northumbrian poet, who
was a herdsman and lay brother in the abbey of Whitby, in the days
<a name = "page16"> </a><span class = "pagenum">16</span>of the abbess Hild,
who died in 680, near the close of the
seventh century. He received the gift of divine song in a vision of
the night; and after the recognition by the abbess and others of his
heavenly call, became a member of the religious fraternity, and
devoted the rest of his life to the composition of sacred poetry.</p>

<blockquote>
He sang (says Beda) the Creation of the world, the origin of the human
race, and all the history of Genesis; the departure of Israel out of
Egypt and their entrance into the land of promise, with many other
histories from holy writ; the incarnation, passion, and resurrection
of our Lord, and His ascension into heaven; the coming of the Holy
Spirit and the teaching of the Apostles. Likewise of the terror of the
future judgement, the horror of punishment in hell, and the bliss of
the heavenly kingdom he made many poems; and moreover, many others
concerning divine benefits and judgements; in all which he sought to
wean men from the love of sin, and to stimulate them to the enjoyment
and pursuit of good action.
</blockquote>

<p>It happens that we still possess some poems which answer more or less
to this description; but they are all of later date and are only known
from copies written in the Southern dialect of Wessex; and, as the
original Northumbrian text has unfortunately perished, we have no
means of knowing to what extent they represent Cædmon’s work. It is
possible that they preserve some of it in a more or less close form of
translation, but we cannot verify this possibility. It has been
ascertained, on the other hand, that a certain portion (but by no
means
<a name = "page17"> </a><span class = "pagenum">17</span>
all) of these poems is adapted, with but slight change,
from an original poem written in the Old Saxon of the continent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it so happens that a short hymn of nine lines has been
preserved nearly in the original form, as Cædmon dictated it; and it
corresponds closely with Beda’s Latin version. It is found at the end
of the Cambridge MS. of Beda’s <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i> in the
following form:</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Nu scylun hergan hefaenricaes uard,<br>
metudæs maecti end his modgidanc,<br>
uerc uuldurfadur; sue he uundra gihuaes,<br>

Tha middungeard moncynnæs uard,<br>
eci Dryctin, æfter tiadæ<br>
firum fold[u], frea allmectig.<br>
</div>

<p>I here subjoin a literal translation.</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Now ought we to praise the warden of heaven’s realm,<br>
the Creator’s might and His mind’s thought,<br>
the works of the Father of glory; (even) as He, of every wonder,<br>
(being) eternal Ruler, established the beginning.<br>
He first (of all) shaped, for the sons of men,<br>
heaven as (their) roof, (He) the holy Creator.<br>
The middle world (He), mankind’s warden,<br>
eternal Ruler, afterwards prepared,<br>
the world for men&mdash;(being the) Almighty Lord.
</div>

<p>The locality of these lines is easily settled, as we
<a name = "page18"> </a><span class = "pagenum">18</span>
may assign
them to Whitby. Similarly, Beda’s Death-song may be assigned to the
county of Durham.</p>

<p>A third poem, extending to fourteen lines, may be called the
“Northumbrian Riddle.” It is called by Dr Sweet the “Leiden Riddle,”
because the MS. that contains it is now at Leyden, in Holland. The
locality is unknown, but we may assign it to Yorkshire or Durham
without going far wrong. There is another copy in a Southern dialect.
These three brief poems, viz. Beda’s Death-song, Cædmon’s Hymn, and
the Riddle, are all printed, accessibly, in Sweet’s <i>Anglo-Saxon
Reader</i>.</p>

<p>There is another relic of Old Northumbrian, apparently belonging to
the middle of the eighth century, which is too remarkable to be passed
over. I refer to the famous Ruthwell cross, situate not far to the
west of Annan, near the southern coast of Dumfriesshire, and near the
English border. On each of its four faces it bears inscriptions; on
two opposite faces in Latin, and on the other two in runic characters.
Each of the latter pair contains a few lines of Northern poetry,
selected from a poem (doubtless by the poet Cynewulf) which is
preserved in full in a much later Southern (or Wessex) copy in a MS.
at Vercelli in Piedmont (Italy). On the side which Professor Stephens
calls <i>the front</i> of the cross, the runic inscriptions give us
two quotations, both imperfect at the end; and the same is true of the
<a name = "page19"> </a><span class = "pagenum">19</span>
opposite side or <i>back</i>. The MS. helps us to restore
letters that are missing or broken, and in this way we can be
tolerably sure of the correct readings.</p>

<p>The two quotations in front are as follows: it will be seen that the
cross itself is supposed to be the speaker.</p>

<p>In the late MS. it is the cross that is wounded by arrows; whereas in
the runic inscription it seems to be implied that it was Christ
Himself that was so wounded. The allusion is in any case very obscure;
but the latter notion makes the better sense, and is capable of being
explained by the Norse legend of Balder, who was frequently shot at by
the other gods in sport, as he was supposed to be invulnerable; but he
was slain thus one day by a shaft made of mistletoe, which alone had
power to harm him.</p>

<p>There is also extant a considerable number of very brief inscriptions,
such as that on a column at Bewcastle, in Cumberland; but they
contribute little to our knowledge except the forms of proper names.
The <i>Liber Vitæ</i> of Durham, written in the ninth century,
contains between three and four thousand such names, but nothing else.</p>

<p>Coming down to the tenth century, we meet with three valuable
documents, all of which are connected
<a name = "page21"> </a><span class = "pagenum">21</span>
with Durham, generally
known as the Durham Ritual and the Northumbrian Gospels.</p>

<p>The Durham Ritual was edited for the Surtees Society in 1840 by the
Rev. J. Stevenson. The MS. is in the Cathedral library at Durham, and
contains three distinct Latin service-books, with Northumbrian glosses
in various later hands, besides a number of unglossed Latin additions.
A small portion of the MS. has been misplaced by the binder; the Latin
prose on pp. 138-145 should follow that on p. 162. Mr Stevenson’s
edition exhibits a rather large number of misreadings, most of which
(I fear not quite all) are noted in my “Collation of the Durham
Ritual” printed in the <i>Philological Society’s Transactions</i>,
1877-9, Appendix <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>.
I give, by way of specimen, a curious passage (at
p. 192), which tells us all about the eight pounds of material that
went to make up the body of Adam.</p>

<p>We thus learn that Adam’s flesh was made of a pound of loam; his
red and hot blood, of fire; his salt tears, of salt; his sweat, of
dew; the colour of his eyes, of flowers; the instability of his
thoughts, of cloud; his cold breath, of wind; and his intelligence, of
grace.</p>

<p>The Northumbrian glosses on the four Gospels are contained in two
MSS., both of remarkable interest and value. The former of these,
sometimes known as the Lindisfarne MS., and sometimes as the Durham
Book, is now MS. Cotton, Nero D. 4 in the British Museum, and is one
of the chief treasures in our national collection. It contains a
beautifully executed Latin text of the four Gospels, written in the
isle of Lindisfarne, by Eadfrith (bishop of Lindisfarne in 698-721),
probably before 700. The interlinear Northumbrian gloss is two and a
half centuries later, and was made by Aldred, a priest, about 950, at
a time when the MS. was kept at Chester-le-Street, near Durham,
whither it had been removed for greater safety. Somewhat later it was
again removed to Durham, where it remained for several centuries.</p>

<p>The second MS. is called the Rushworth MS., as it was presented to the
Bodleian Library (Oxford) by John Rushworth, who was deputy-clerk to
the House of Commons during the Long Parliament. The Latin text was
written, probably in the eighth century, by a scribe named Macregol.
The gloss, written in the latter half of the tenth century, is in two
hands,
<a name = "page23"> </a><span class = "pagenum">23</span>
those of Farman and Owun, whose names are given. Farman
was a priest of Harewood, on the river Wharfe, in the West Riding of
Yorkshire. He glossed the whole of St Matthew’s Gospel, and a very
small portion of St Mark. It is worthy of especial notice, that his
gloss, throughout St Matthew, is not in the Northumbrian dialect, but
in a form of Mercian. But it is clear that when he had completed this
first Gospel, he borrowed the Lindisfarne MS. as a guide to help him,
and kept it before him when he began to gloss St Mark. He at once
began to copy the glosses in the older MS., with slight occasional
variations in the grammar; but he soon tired of his task, and turned
it over to Owun, who continued it to the end. The result is that the
Northumbrian glosses in this MS., throughout the three last Gospels,
are of no great value, as they tell us little more than can be better
learnt from the Durham book; on the other hand, Farman’s Mercian gloss
to St Matthew is of high value, but need not be considered at present.
Hence it is best in this case to rely, for our knowledge of Old
Northumbrian, on the Durham book <i>alone</i>.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that a gloss is not quite the same thing as a
free translation that observes the rules of grammar. A gloss
translates the Latin text word by word, in the order of that text; so
that the glossator can neither observe the natural English order nor
in all cases preserve the English grammar;
<a name = "page24"> </a><span class = "pagenum">24</span>
a fact which somewhat
lessens its value, and must always be allowed for. It is therefore
necessary, in all cases, to ascertain the Latin text. I subjoin a
specimen, from Matt, <span class = "smallcaps">v</span> 11-15.</p>

<p>The history of the Northern dialect during the next three centuries, from

<h2>THE DIALECTS OF NORTHUMBRIA; A.D. 1300-1400</h2>

<p>A little before 1300, we come to a <i>Metrical English Psalter</i>,
published by the Surtees Society in 1843-7. The language is supposed to
represent the speech of Yorkshire. It is translated (rather closely) from
the Latin Vulgate version. I give a specimen from Psalm xviii, 14-20.</p>

<p>The literal sense is:&mdash;“He sent His arrows and scattered them;
multiplied (His) lightning and so afflicted them. And the wells of
waters were shown, and the foundations of the earthly world are
uncovered because of Thy snubbing (rebuke), O my Lord! because of the
blast (Lat. <i>inspiratio</i>) of the breath of Thy wrath. He sent
from on high, and took me up; from many waters He took me. He took me
out there-among from my foes that were so strong, and from those that
alway hated me; for they were strengthened together over me. They came
before me in the day of affliction, and the Lord is made my
protection. And He led me (so as) to be in a broad place; He made me
safe, because He desired (lit. would) me; and the Lord shall requite
me according to all my righteousness, and according to the cleanness
of my hands shall He repay me in the end.”</p>

<p>In this specimen we can already discern some of the chief
characteristics which are so conspicuous in Lowland Scotch MSS. of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The most striking is the almost
total loss of the final <i>-e</i> which is so frequently required to
form an extra syllable when we try to scan the poetry of
<a name = "page27"> </a><span class = "pagenum">27</span>Chaucer.
Even where a final <i>-e</i> is written in the above
extract, it is wholly silent. The words <i>ware</i> (were), <i>are</i>
(are), <i>myne</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>toke</i>, <i>made</i>,
<i>brede</i>, <i> hende</i>, <i>ende</i>, are all monosyllabic; and in
fact the large number of monosyllabic words is very striking. The
words <i>onesprute</i>, <i>forcome</i>, <i>foryhelde</i> are, in like
manner, dissyllabic. The only suffixes that count in the scansion are
<i>-en</i>, <i>-ed</i>, and <i>-es</i>; as in <i>sam-en</i>, <i>
skat’r-èd</i>, <i>drev-èd</i>, <i>hat-èd</i>, etc., and <i>arw-ès</i>,
<i>well-ès</i>, <i>watr-ès</i>, etc. The curious form <i>sal</i>, for
“shall,” is a Northern characteristic. So also is the form
<i>hende</i> as the plural of “hand”; the Southern plural was often
<i>hond-en</i>, and the Midland form was <i>hond-ès</i> or <i>hand-ès</i>.
Note also the characteristic long <i>a</i>; as in <i>swa</i>
for <i>swo</i>, so; <i>gast</i>, ghost; <i>fra</i>, fro; <i>faas</i>,
foes. It was pronounced like the <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>.</p>

<p>A much longer specimen of the <i>Metrical English Psalter</i> will be
found in <i>Specimens of Early English</i>, ed. Morris and Skeat, Part
<span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>, pp. 23-34, and is easily accessible.
In the same volume, the
Specimens numbered <span class = "smallcaps">vii, viii, x, xi</span>,
and <span class = "smallcaps">xvi</span> are also in Northumbrian,
and can easily be examined. It will therefore suffice to give a very
brief account of each.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Cursor Mundi</i>, or <i>Cursor o Werld</i>, i.e. Over-runner
of the World; so called because it rehearses a great part of the
world’s history, from the creation onwards. It is a poem of portentous
length, extending
<a name = "page28"> </a><span class = "pagenum">28</span>
to 29,655 lines, and recounts many of the
events found in the Old and New Testaments, with the addition of
legends from many other sources, one of them, for example, being the
<i>Historia Scholastica</i> of Peter Comestor. Dr Murray thinks it may
have been written in the neighbourhood of Durham. The specimen given
(pp. 69-82) corresponds to lines 11373-11796.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Sunday Homilies in Verse</i>; about 1330. The extracts are
taken from <i>English Metrical Homilies</i>, edited by J. Small
(Edinburgh, 1862) from a MS. in Edinburgh. The Northern dialect is
well marked, but I do not know to what locality to assign it.</p>

<p>X. Richard Rolle, of Hampole, near Doncaster, wrote a poem called
<i>The Prick of Conscience</i>, about 1340. It extends to 9624 lines,
and was edited by Dr Morris for the Philological Society in 1863. The
Preface to this edition is of especial value, as it carefully
describes the characteristics of Northumbrian, and practically laid
the foundation of our knowledge of the old dialects as exhibited in
MSS. Lists are given of orthographical differences between the
Northern dialect and others, and an analysis is added giving the
grammatical details which determine its Northern character. Much of
this information is repeated in the Introduction to the <i>Specimens
of English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>, pp. xviii-xxxviii.</p>

<a name = "page29"> </a><span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<p>XI. <i>The Poems of Laurence Minot</i> belong to the middle of the
fourteenth century. He composed eleven poems in celebration of events
that occurred between the years 1333 and 1352. They were first printed
by Ritson in 1795; and subsequently by T. Wright, in his <i>Political
Poems and Songs</i> (London, 1859); and are now very accessible in the
excellent and cheap (second) edition by Joseph Hall (Oxford University
Press). There is also a German edition by Dr Wilhelm Scholle. The poet
seems to have been connected with Yorkshire, and the dialect is not
purely Northern, as it shows a slight admixture of Midland forms.</p>

<p>XVI. <i>The Bruce</i>; by John Barbour; partly written in 1375. It has
been frequently printed, viz. in 1616, 1620, 1670, 1672, 1715, 1737,
and 1758; and was edited by Pinkerton in 1790, by Jamieson in 1820,
and by Cosmo Innes in 1866; also by myself (for the Early English Text
Society) in 1870-89; and again (for the Scottish Text Society) in
1893-5. Unfortunately, the two extant MSS. were both written out about
a century after the date of composition. Nevertheless, we have the
text of more than 260 lines as it existed in 1440, as this portion was
quoted by Andro of Wyntown, in his <i>Cronykil of Scotland</i>,
written at that date. I quote some lines from this portion, taken from
<i>The Bruce</i>, Book i, 37-56, 91-110; with a few explanations in
the footnotes.</p>

<p>In this extract, as in that from the <i>Metrical Psalter</i> above,
there is a striking preponderance of monosyllables, and, as in that
case also, the final <i>-e</i> is invariably silent in such words as
<i>oure</i>, <i>stere</i>, <i>lede</i>, <i>yhere</i>, <i>thare</i>,
<i>were</i>, etc., just as in modern English. The grammar is, for the
most part, extremely simple, as at the present day. The chief
difficulty lies in the vocabulary, which contains some words that are
either obsolete or provincial. Many of the obsolete words are found in
other dialects; thus <i>stere</i>, to control, <i>perfay</i>,
<i>fonden</i> (for <i>fanden</i>), <i>chesen</i>, to choose,
<i>feloun</i>, adj. meaning “angry,” <i>take kepe</i>,
<i>soiourne</i>, to tarry, <i>travaile</i>, to labour, <i>parage</i>,
rank, all occur in Chaucer; <i>barnage</i>, <i>reauté</i>, in
<i>William of Palerne</i> (in the Midland dialect, possibly
Shropshire); <i>oughte</i>, owned, possessed, <i>tyne</i>, to lose, in
<i>Piers the Plowman</i>;
<a name = "page32"> </a><span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<i>umbethinken</i>, in the <i>Ormulum</i>; <i>enkerly</i> (for
<i>inkkyrly</i>), in the alliterative <i>Morte Arthure</i>;
<i>march</i>, to border upon, in <i>Mandeville</i>; <i>seignorie</i>,
in <i>Robert of Gloucester</i>. Barbour is rather fond of introducing
French words; <i>rybalddale</i> occurs in no other author.
<i>Threllage</i> or <i>thryllage</i> may have been coined from
<i>threll</i> (English <i>thrall</i>), by adding a French suffix. As
to the difficult word <i>nyt</i>, see <i>Nite</i> in the <i>N.E.D.</i></p>

<p>In addition to the poems, etc., already mentioned, further material
may be found in the prose works of Richard Rolle of Hampole,
especially his translation and exposition of the Psalter, edited by
the Rev. H.R. Bramley (Oxford, 1884), and the Prose Treatises edited
by the Rev. G.G. Perry for the Early English Text Society. Dr Murray
further calls attention to the Early Scottish Laws, of which the
vernacular translations partly belong to the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>I have now mentioned the chief authorities for the study of the
Northern dialect from early times down to 1400. Examination of them
leads directly to a result but little known, and one that is in direct
contradiction to general uninstructed opinion; namely that, down to
this date, the varieties of Northumbrian are much fewer and slighter
than they afterwards became, and that the written documents are
practically all in one and the same dialect, or very nearly so, from
the Humber as far north as Aberdeen. The irrefragable results noted by
Dr Murray will
<a name = "page33"> </a><span class = "pagenum">33</span>
probably come as a surprise to many, though they
have now been before the public for more than forty years. The Durham
dialect of the <i>Cursor Mundi</i> and the Aberdeen Scotch of Barbour
are hardly distinguishable by grammatical or orthographical tests; and
both bear a remarkable resemblance to the Yorkshire dialect as found
in Hampole. What is now called Lowland Scotch is so nearly descended
from the Old Northumbrian that the latter was invariably called
“Ingliss” by the writers who employed it; and they reserved the name
of “Scottish” to designate Gaelic or Erse, the tongue of the original
“Scots,” who gave their name to the country. Barbour (<i>Bruce</i>,
<span class = "smallcaps">iv</span>
253) calls his own language “Ynglis.” Andro of Wyntown does the same,
near the beginning of the Prologue to his <i>Cronykil</i>. The most
striking case is that of Harry the Minstrel, who was so opposed to all
Englanders, from a political point of view, that his whole poem
breathes fury and hatred against them; and yet, in describing
Wallace’s French friend, Longueville, who knew no tongue but his own,
he says of him (<i>Wallace</i>, <span class = "smallcaps">ix</span> 295-7):</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Lykly he was, manlik of contenance,<br>
<i>Lik to the Scottis</i> be mekill governance<br>
<i>Saiff off his tong</i>, for <i>Inglis</i> had he nane.
</div>

<p>Later still, Dunbar, near the conclusion of his <i>Golden Targe</i>,
apostrophises Chaucer as being “in <i>oure Tong</i>
<a name = "page34"> </a><span class = "pagenum">34</span>
ane flouir imperiall,” and says that he was “<i>of oure Inglisch</i> all the
lycht.” It was not till 1513 that Gawain Douglas, in the Prologue to
the first book of his translation of Virgil, claimed to have “writtin
in the langage of Scottis natioun”; though Sir David Lyndesay, writing
twenty-two years later, still gives the name of the “Inglisch toung”
to the vulgar tongue of Scotland, in his <i>Satyre of the three
Estaitis</i>.</p>

<p>We should particularly notice Dr Murray’s statement, in his essay on
<i>The Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland</i>, at p. 29,
that “Barbour at Aberdeen, and Richard Rolle de Hampole near
Doncaster, wrote for their several countrymen in the same identical
dialect.” The division between the English of the Scottish Lowlands
and the English of Yorkshire was purely political, having no reference
to race or speech, but solely to locality; and yet, as Dr Murray
remarks, the struggle for supremacy “made every one either an
Englishman or a Scotchman, and made English and Scotch names of
division and bitter enmity.” So strong, indeed, was the division thus
created that it has continued to the present day; and it would be very
difficult even now to convince a native of the Scottish Lowlands&mdash;unless
he is a philologist&mdash;that he is likely to be of Anglian
descent, and to have a better title to be called an “Englishman” than
a native of Hampshire or Devon, who, after all, may be only a Saxon.
And of course it is
<a name = "page35"> </a><span class = "pagenum">35</span>
easy enough to show how widely the old
“Northern” dialect varies from the difficult Southern English found in
the Kentish <i>Ayenbite of Inwyt</i>, or even from the Midland of
Chaucer’s poems.</p>

<p>To quote from Dr Murray once more (p. 41):</p>

<blockquote>
“the facts are still far from being generally known, and I have
repeatedly been amused, on reading passages from <i>Cursor Mundi</i>
and Hampole to men of education, both English and Scotch, to hear them
all pronounce the dialect ‘Old Scotch.’ Great has been the surprise of
the latter especially on being told that Richard the Hermit [i.e. of
Hampole] wrote in the extreme south of Yorkshire, within a few miles
of a locality so thoroughly English as Sherwood Forest, with its
memories of Robin Hood. Such is the difficulty which people have in
separating the natural and ethnological relations in which national
names originate from the accidental values which they acquire through
political complications and the fortunes of crowns and dynasties, that
oftener than once the protest has been made&mdash;‘Then he must have been a
Scotchman settled there!’”
</blockquote>

<p>The retort is obvious enough, that Barbour and Henry the Minstrel and
Dunbar and Lyndesay have all recorded that their native language was
“Inglis” or “Inglisch”; and it is interesting to note that, having
regard to the pronunciation, they seem to have known, better than we
do, how that name ought to be spelt.</p>

<h2>NORTHUMBRIAN IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</h2>

<p>The subject of the last chapter was one of great importance. When it
is once understood that, down to 1400 or a little later, the men of
the Scottish Lowlands and the men of the northern part of England
spoke not only the same language, but the same dialect of that
language, it becomes easy to explain what happened afterwards.</p>

<p>There was, nevertheless, one profound difference between the
circumstances of the language spoken to the north of the Tweed and
that spoken to the south of it. In Scotland, the Northumbrian dialect
was spoken by all but the Celts, without much variety; the minor
differences need not be here considered. And this dialect, called
Inglis (as we have seen) by the Lowlanders themselves, had no rival,
as the difference between it and the Erse or Gaelic was obvious and
immutable.</p>

<p>To the South of the Tweed, the case was different. England already
possessed three dialects at least, viz. Northumbrian, Mercian, and
Saxon, i.e. Northern,
<a name = "page37"> </a><span class = "pagenum">37</span>
Midland, and Southern; besides which,
Midland had at the least two main varieties, viz. Eastern and Western.
Between all these there was a long contention for supremacy. In very
early days, the Northern took the lead, but its literature was
practically destroyed by the Danes, and it never afterwards attained
to anything higher than a second place. From the time of Alfred, the
standard language of literature was the Southern, and it kept the lead
till long after the Conquest, well down to 1200 and even later, as
will be explained hereafter. But the Midland dialect, which is not
without witness to its value in the ninth century, began in the
thirteenth to assume an important position, which in the fourteenth
became dominant and supreme, exalted as it was by the genius of
Chaucer. Its use was really founded on practical convenience. It was
intermediate between the other two, and could be more or less
comprehended both by the Northerner and the Southerner, though these
could hardly understand each other. The result was, naturally, that
whilst the Northumbrian to the north of the Tweed was practically
supreme, the Northumbrian to the south of it soon lost its position as
a literary medium. It thus becomes clear that we must, during the
fifteenth century, treat the Northumbrian of England and that of
Scotland separately. Let us first investigate its position in England.</p>

<a name = "page38"> </a><span class = "pagenum">38</span>

<p>But before this can be appreciated, it is necessary to draw
attention to the fact that the literature of the fifteenth century, in
nearly all the text-books that treat of the subject, has been most
unjustly underrated. The critics, nearly all with one accord, repeat
the remark that it is a “barren” period, with nothing admirable about
it, at any rate in England; that it shows us the works of Hoccleve and
Lydgate near the beginning, <i>The Flower and the Leaf</i> near the
middle (about 1460), and the ballad of <i>The Nut-brown Maid</i> at
the end of it, and nothing else that is remarkable. In other words,
they neglect its most important characteristic, that it was the chief
period of the lengthy popular romances and of the popular plays out of
which the great dramas of the succeeding century took their rise. To
which it deserves to be added that it contains many short poems of a
fugitive character, whilst a vast number of very popular ballads were
in constant vogue, sometimes handed down without much change by a
faithful tradition, but more frequently varied by the fancy of the
more competent among the numerous wandering minstrels. To omit from
the fifteenth century nearly all account of its romances and plays and
ballads is like omitting the part of Hamlet the Dane from
Shakespeare’s greatest tragedy.</p>

<p>The passion for long romances or romantic poems had already arisen in
the fourteenth century, and, to
<a name = "page39"> </a><span class = "pagenum">39</span>
some extent, in the thirteenth.
Even just before 1300, we meet with the lays of <i>Havelok</i> and
<i>Horn</i>. In the fourteenth century, it is sufficient to mention
the romances of <i>Sir Guy of Warwick</i> (the earlier version),
<i>Sir Bevis of Hamtoun</i>, and <i>Libeaus Desconus</i>, all
mentioned by Chaucer; <i>Sir Launfal</i>, <i>The Seven Sages</i>
(earlier version, as edited by Weber); <i>Lai le Freine</i>,
<i>Richard Coer de Lion</i>, <i>Amis and Amiloun</i>, <i>The King of
Tars</i>, <i>William of Palerne</i>, <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i> (a
fragment), <i>Sir Gawain and the Grene Knight</i>, <i>Alisaunder of
Macedoine</i> and <i>Alexander and Dindimus</i> (two fragments of one
very long poem), <i>Sir Ferumbras</i>, and <i>Sir Isumbras</i>. The
spirited romance generally known as the alliterative <i>Morte
Arthure</i> must also belong here, though the MS. itself is of later
date.</p>

<p>The series was actively continued during the fifteenth century, when
we find, besides others, the romances of <i>Iwain and Gawain</i>,
<i>Sir Percival</i>, and <i>Sir Cleges</i>; <i>The Sowdon</i> (Sultan)
<i>of Babylon</i>; <i>The Aunturs</i> (Adventures) <i>of Arthur</i>,
<i>Sir Amadas</i>, <i>The Avowing of Arthur</i>, and <i>The Life of
Ipomidoun</i>; <i>The Wars of Alexander</i>, <i>The Seven Sages</i>
(later version, edited by Wright); <i>Torrent of Portugal</i>, <i>Sir
Gowther</i>, <i>Sir Degrevant</i>, <i>Sir Eglamour</i>, <i>Le Bone
Florence of Rome</i>, and <i>Partonope of Blois</i>; the prose version
of <i>Merlin</i>, the later version of <i>Sir Guy of Warwick</i>, and
the verse Romance, of immense
<a name = "page40"> </a><span class = "pagenum">40</span>
length, of <i>The Holy Grail</i>;
<i>Emare</i>, <i>The Erl of Tolous</i>, and <i>The Squire of Low
Degree</i>. Towards the end of the century, when the printing-press
was already at work, we find Caxton greatly busying himself to
continue the list. Not only did he give us the whole of Sir Thomas
Malory’s <i>Morte D’Arthur</i>, “enprynted and fynysshed in thabbey
Westmestre the last day of Iuyl, the yere of our lord MCCCCLXXXV”; but
he actually translated several romances into very good English prose
on his own account, viz. <i>Godefroy of Boloyne</i> (1481), <i>Charles
the Grete</i> (1485), <i>The Knight Paris and the fair Vyene</i>
(1485), <i>Blanchardyn and Eglantine</i> (about 1489), and <i>The Four
Sons of Aymon</i> (about 1490). We must further put to the credit of
the fifteenth century the remarkable English version of the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, and many more versions by Caxton, such as <i>The
Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</i>, <i>The Life of Jason</i>,
<i>Eneydos</i> (which is Virgil’s <i>Æneid</i> in the form of a prose
romance), <i>The Golden Legend</i> or Lives of Saints, and <i>Reynard
the Fox</i>. When all these works are considered, the fifteenth
century emerges with considerable credit.</p>

<p>It remains to look at some of the above-named romances a little more
closely, in order to see if any of them are in the dialect of Northern
England. Some of them are written by scribes belonging to other parts,
but there seems to be little doubt that
<a name = "page41"> </a><span class = "pagenum">41</span>
the following were in
that dialect originally, viz. (1) <i>Iwain and Gawain</i>, printed in
Ritson’s <i>Ancient Metrical Romances</i>, and belonging to the very
beginning of the century, extant in the same MS. as that which
contains Minot’s <i>Poems</i>: (2) <i>The Wars of Alexander</i> (Early
English Text Society, 1886), edited by myself; see the Preface, pp.
xv, xix, for proofs that it was originally written in a pure
Northumbrian dialect, which the better of the two MSS. very fairly
preserves. Others exhibit strong traces of a Northern dialect, such as
<i>The Aunturs of Arthur</i>, <i>Sir Amadas</i>, and <i>The Avowing of
Arthur</i>, but they may be in a West Midland dialect, not far removed
from the North. In the preface to <i>The Sege of Melayne</i> (Milan)
<i>and Roland and Otuel</i>, edited for the Early English Text Society
by S. J. Herrtage, it is suggested that both these poems were by the
author of <i>Sir Percival</i>, and that all three were originally in
the dialect of the North of England.</p>

<p><i>Iwain and Gawain</i> and <i>The Wars of Alexander</i> belong to
quite the beginning of the fifteenth century, and they appear to be
among the latest examples of the literary use of dialect in the North
of England considered as a vehicle for romances; but we must not
forget the “miracle plays,” and in particular <i>The Towneley
Mysteries</i> or plays acted at or near Wakefield in Yorkshire, and
<i>The York Plays</i>, lately edited by Miss Toulmin Smith. Examples
of Southern
<a name = "page42"> </a><span class = "pagenum">42</span>
English likewise come to an end about the same time;
it is most remarkable how very soon, after the death of Chaucer, the
Midland dialect not only assumed a leading position, but enjoyed that
proud position almost alone. The rapid loss of numerous inflexions,
soon after 1400, made that dialect, which was already in possession of
such important centres as London, Oxford, and Cambridge, much easier
to learn, and brought its grammar much nearer to that in use in the
North. It even compromised, as it were, with that dialect by accepting
from it the general use of such important words as <i>they</i>,
<i>their</i>, <i>them</i>, the plural verb <i>are</i>, and the
preposition <i>till</i>. There can be little doubt that one of the
causes of the cessation of varying forms of words in literary use was
the civil strife known as the Wars of the Roses, which must for a
brief period have been hostile to all literary activity; and very
shortly afterwards the printing-presses of London all combined to
recognise, in general, one dialect only.</p>

<p>Hence it came about, by a natural but somewhat rapid process, that the
only dialect which remained unaffected by the triumph of the Midland
variety was that portion of the Northern dialect which still held its
own in Scotland, where it was spoken by subjects of another king. As
far as literature was concerned, only two dialects were available, the
Northumbrian of Scotland and the East Midland in
<a name = "page43"> </a><span class = "pagenum">43</span>
England. It is
obvious that the readiest way of distinguishing between the two is to
call the one “Scottish” and the other “English,” ignoring accuracy for
the sake of practical convenience. This is precisely what happened in
course of time, and the new nomenclature would have done no harm if
the study of Middle English had been at all general. But such was not
the case, and the history of our literature was so much neglected that
even those who should have been well informed knew no better than
others. The chief modern example is the well-known case of that most
important and valuable book entitled <i>An Etymological Dictionary of
the Scottish Language</i>, by John Jamieson, D.D., first published in
Edinburgh in 1808. There is no great harm in the title, if for
“Language” we read “Dialect”; but this great and monumental work was
unluckily preceded by a “Dissertation on the Origin of the Scottish
Language,” in which wholly mistaken and wrongheaded views are
supported with great ingenuity and much show of learning. In the
admirable new edition of “Jamieson” by Longmuir and Donaldson,
published at Paisley in 1879, this matter is set right. They quite
rightly reprint this “Dissertation,” which affords valuable testimony
as to the study of English in 1808, but accompany it with most
judicious remarks, which are well worthy of full repetition.</p>

<blockquote>
“That once famous Dissertation can now be considered only a
<a name = "page44"> </a><span class = "pagenum">44</span>
notable feat of literary card-building; more remarkable for the
skill and ingenuity of its construction than for its architectural
correctness, strength and durability, or practical usefulness. That
the language of the Scottish Lowlands is in all important particulars
the same as that of the northern counties of England, will be evident
to any unbiassed reader who takes the trouble to compare the Scottish
Dictionary with the Glossaries of Brockett, Atkinson, and Peacock. And
the similarity is attested in another way by the simple but important
fact, that regarding some of our Northern Metrical Romances it is
still disputed whether they were composed to the north or the south of
the Tweed.... And to this conclusion all competent scholars have given
their consent.”
</blockquote>

<p>For those who really understand the situation there is no harm in
accepting the distinction between “Scottish” and “English,” as
explained above. Hence it is that the name of “Middle Scots” has been
suggested for “the literary language of Scotland written between the
latter half of the fifteenth century and the early decades of the
seventeenth.” Most of this literature is highly interesting, at any
rate much more so than the “English” literature of the same period, as
has been repeatedly remarked. Indeed, this is so well known that
special examples are needless; I content myself with referring to the
<i>Specimens of Middle Scots</i>, by G. Gregory Smith, Edinburgh
<a name = "page45"> </a><span class = "pagenum">45</span>
and London, 1902. These specimens include extracts from such
famous authors as Henryson, Dunbar, Gawain (or Gavin) Douglas, Sir
David Lyndesay, John Knox, and George Buchanan. Perhaps it is well to
add that “Scottis” or “Scots” is the Northern form of “Scottish” or
“Scotch”; just as “Inglis” is the Northern form of “English.”</p>

<p>“Middle Scots” implies both “Old Scots” and “Modern Scots.” “Old
Scots” is, of course, the same thing as Northumbrian or Northern
English of the Middle English Period, which may be roughly dated as
extant from 1300 to 1400 or 1450. “Modern Scots” is the dialect (when
they employ dialect) illustrated by Allan Ramsay, Alexander Ross,
Robert Tannahill, John Galt, James Hogg (the Ettrick Shepherd), Robert
Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and very many others.</p>

<p>I conclude this chapter with a characteristic example of Middle Scots.
The following well-known passage is from the conclusion to Dunbar’s
<i>Golden Targe</i>.</p>

<h2>THE SOUTHERN DIALECT</h2>

<p>We have seen that the earliest dialect to assume literary supremacy
was the Northern, and that at a very early date, namely, in the
seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries; but its early documents have
nearly all perished. If, with the exception of one short fragment, any
of Cædmon’s poems have survived, they only exist in Southern versions
of a much later date.</p>

<p>The chief fosterer of our rather extensive Wessex (or Southern)
literature, commonly called Anglo-Saxon, was the great Alfred, born at
Wantage in Berkshire, to the south of the Thames. We may roughly
define the limits of the Old Southern dialect by saying that it
formerly included all the counties to the south of the Thames and to
the west and south-west of Berkshire, including Wiltshire,
Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, and Devonshire, but excluding Cornwall, in
which the Cornish dialect of Celtic prevailed. It was at Athelney in
Somersetshire, near the junction of the rivers Tone and Parrett,
<a name = "page48"> </a><span class = "pagenum">48</span>
that Alfred, in the memorable year 878, when his dominions were
reduced to a precarious sway over two or three counties, established
his famous stronghold; from which he issued to inflict upon the foes
of the future British empire a crushing and decisive defeat. And it
was near Athelney, in the year 1693, that the ornament of gold and
enamel was found, with its famous legend&mdash;ÆLFRED MEC HEHT
GEWYRCAN&mdash;“Ælfred commanded (men) to make me.”</p>

<p>From his date to the Norman Conquest, the MSS. in the Anglo-Saxon or
Southern dialect are fairly numerous, and it is mainly to them that we
owe our knowledge of the grammar, the metre, and the pronunciation of
the older forms of English. Sweet’s <i>Anglo-Saxon Primer</i> will
enable any one to begin the study of this dialect, and to learn
something valuable about it in the course of a month or two.</p>

<p>The famous <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, beginning with a note
concerning the year 1, when Augustus was emperor of Rome, not only
continues our history down to the Conquest, but for nearly a century
beyond it, to the year 1154. The language of the latter part, as
extant in the (Midland) Laud MS., belongs to the twelfth century, and
shows considerable changes in the spelling and grammar as compared
with the Parker MS., which (not counting in a few later entries) ends
with the year 1001.</p>

<p>After the Conquest, the Southern dialect continued
<a name = "page49"> </a><span class = "pagenum">49</span>
to be the
literary language, and we have several examples of it. Extracts from
some of the chief works are given in Part
<span class = "smallcaps">i</span> of Morris’s <i>Specimens
of Early English</i>. They are selected from the following: (1) <i>Old
English Homilies</i>, 1150-1200, as printed for the Early English Text
Society, and edited by Dr Morris, 1867-8. (2) <i>Old English Homilies,
Second Series</i>, before 1200, ed. Morris (E.E.T.S.), 1873. (3)
<i>The Brut</i>, being a versified chronicle of the legendary history
of Britain, compiled by Layamon, a Worcestershire priest, and
extending to 32,240 (short) lines; in two versions, the date of the
earlier being about 1205. (4) <i>A Life of St Juliana</i>, in two
versions, about 1210; ed. Cockayne and Brock (E.E.T.S.), 1872. (5)
<i>The Ancren Riwle</i>, or Rule of anchorite nuns (Camden Society),
ed. Morton, 1853; the date of composition is about 1210. (6) <i>The
Proverbs of Alfred</i>, about 1250; printed in Dr Morris’s <i>Old
English Miscellany</i> (E.E.T.S.), 1872. A later edition, by myself,
was printed at Oxford in 1907. (7) A poem by Nicholas de Guildford,
entitled <i>The Owl and the Nightingale</i>, about 1250; ed. Rev. J.
Stevenson, 1838; ed. T. Wright, 1843; ed. F.H. Stratmann, of Krefeld,
1868. (8) A curious poem of nearly 400 long lines, usually known as
<i>A Moral Ode</i>, which seems to have been originally written at
Christchurch, Hampshire, and frequently printed; one version is in
Morris’s <i>Old English Homilies</i>, and another in the
<a name = "page50"> </a><span class = "pagenum">50</span>
Second
Series of the same. (9) <i>The Romance of King Horn</i>; before 1300,
here printed in full.</p>

<p>Just at the very end of the century we meet with two Southern poems of
vast length. <i>The Metrical Chronicle</i> of Robert of Gloucester,
comprising the History of Britain from the Siege of Troy to the year
1272, the date of the accession of Edward I, and written in the
dialect of Gloucester, was completed in 1298. It must seem strange to
many to find that our history is thus connected with the Siege of
Troy; but it must be remembered that our old histories, including
Layamon’s poem of <i>The Brut</i> mentioned above, usually included
the fabulous history of very early Britain as narrated by Geoffrey of
Monmouth; and it is useful to remember that we owe to this
circumstance such important works as Shakespeare’s <i>King Lear</i>
and <i>Cymbeline</i>, as well as the old play of <i>Locrine</i>, once
attributed to Shakespeare. According to Robert’s version of Geoffrey’s
story, Britain was originally called Brutain, after Brut or Brutus,
the son of Æneas. Locrin was the eldest son of Brutus and his wife
Innogen, and defeated Humber, king of Hungary, in a great battle;
after which Humber was drowned in the river which still bears his
name. Locrin’s daughter Averne (or Sabre in Geoffrey) was drowned
likewise, in the river which was consequently called Severn. The
British king Bathulf (or, in Geoffrey, Bladud) was the builder of
Bath; and the
<a name = "page51"> </a><span class = "pagenum">51</span>
son of Bladud was Leir, who had three daughters,
named Gornorille, Began, and Cordeille. Kymbel (in Geoffrey,
Kymbelinus), who had been brought up by Augustus Cæsar, was king of
Britain at the time of the birth of Christ; his sons were Guider and
Arvirag (Guiderius and Arviragus). Another king of Britain was King
Cole, who gave name (says Geoffrey falsely) to Colchester. We come
into touch with authentic history with the reign of Vortigern, when
Hengist and Horsa sailed over to Britain. An extract from Robert of
Gloucester is given in <i>Specimens of Early English</i>,
Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>.</p>

<p>The other great work of the same date is the vast collection edited
for the Early English Text Society by Dr Horstmann in 1887, entitled,
<i>The Early South-English Legendary</i>, or Lives of Saints. It is
extant in several MSS., of which the oldest (MS. Laud 108) originally
contained 67 Lives; with an Appendix, in a later hand, containing two
more. The eleventh Life is that of St Dunstan, which is printed in
<i>Specimens of Early English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>,
from another MS.</p>

<p>Soon after the year 1300 the use of the Southern dialect becomes much
less frequent, with the exception of such pieces as belong
particularly to the county of Kent and will be considered by
themselves. There are two immense manuscript collections of various
poems, originally in various dialects, which are worth
<a name = "page52"> </a><span class = "pagenum">52</span>
notice.
One of these is the Harleian MS. No. 2253, in the British Museum, the
scribe of which has reduced everything into the South-Western dialect,
though it is plain that, in many cases, it is not the dialect in which
the pieces were originally composed; this famous manuscript belongs to
the beginning of the fourteenth century. Many poems were printed from
it, with the title of <i>Altenglische Dichtungen</i>, by Dr K.
Böddeker, in 1878. Another similar collection is contained in the
Vernon MS. at Oxford, and belongs to the very end of the same century;
the poems in it are all in a Southern dialect, which is that of the
scribe. It contains, e.g., a copy of the earliest version of <i>Piers
the Plowman</i>, which would have been far more valuable if the scribe
had retained the spelling of his copy. This may help us to realise one
of the great difficulties which beset the study of dialects, namely,
that we usually find copies of old poems reduced to the scribe’s
<i>own</i> dialect; and it may easily happen that such a copy varies
considerably from the correct form.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that the rapid rise and spread of the
Midland dialect during the fourteenth century practically put an end
to the literary use of Northern not long after 1400, except in
Scotland. It affected Southern in the same way, but at a somewhat
earlier date; so that (even in Kent) it is very difficult to find a
Southern work after 1350. There
<a name = "page53"> </a><span class = "pagenum">53</span>
is, however, one remarkable
exception in the case of a work which may be dated in 1387, written by
John Trevisa. Trevisa (as the prefix Tre- suggests) was a native of
Cornwall, but he resided chiefly in Gloucestershire, where he was
vicar of Berkeley, and chaplain to Thomas Lord Berkeley. The work to
which I here refer is known as his translation of Higden. Ralph
Higden, a Benedictine monk in the Abbey of St Werburg at Chester,
wrote in Latin a long history of the world in general, and of Britain
in particular, with the title of the <i>Polychronicon</i>, which
achieved considerable popularity. The first book of this history
contains 60 chapters, the first of which begins with P, the second
with R, and so on. If all these initials are copied out in their
actual order, we obtain a complete sentence, as follows:&mdash;“Presentem
cronicam compilavit Frater Ranulphus Cestrensis monachus”; i.e.
Brother Ralph, monk of Chester, compiled the present chronicle. I
mention this curious device on the part of Higden because another
similar acrostic occurs elsewhere. It so happens that Higden’s
<i>Polychronicon</i> was continued, after his death, by John Malverne,
who brought down the history to a later date, and included in it an
account of a certain Thomas Usk, with whom he seems to have been
acquainted. Now, in a lengthy prose work of about 1387, called <i>The
Testament of Love</i>, I one day
<a name = "page54"> </a><span class = "pagenum">54</span>
discovered that its author had
adopted a similar device&mdash;no doubt imitating Higden&mdash;and had so
arranged that the initial letters of his chapters should form a
sentence, as follows:&mdash;“Margarete of virtw, have merci on Thsknvi.”
There is no difficulty about the expression “Margarete of virtw,”
because the treatise itself explains that it means Holy Church, but I
could make nothing of <i>Thsknvi</i>, as the letters evidently require
rearrangement. But Mr Henry Bradley, one of the editors of the <i>New
English Dictionary</i>, discovered that the chapters near the end of
the treatise are out of order; and when he had restored sense by
putting them as they should be, the new reading of the last seven
letters came out as “thin vsk,” i.e. “thine Usk”; and the attribution
of this treatise to Thomas Usk clears up every difficulty and fits in
with all that John Malverne says. This, in fact, is the happy solution
of the authorship of <i>The Testament of Love</i>, which was once
attributed to Chaucer, though it is obviously not his at all.</p>

<p>But it is time to return to John Trevisa, Higden’s translator. This
long translation is all in the Southern dialect, originally that of
Gloucestershire, though there are several MSS. that do not always
agree. A fair copy of it, from a MS. in the library of St John’s
College, Cambridge, is given side by side with the original Latin in
the edition already noticed. It
<a name = "page55"> </a><span class = "pagenum">55</span>
is worth adding that Caxton
printed Trevisa’s version, altering the spelling to suit that of his
own time, and giving several variations of reading.</p>

<p>Trevisa was also the author of some other works, of which the most
important is his translation into English, from the original Latin, of
<i>Bartholomæus de Proprietatibus Rerum</i>.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any important work in the Southern dialect later
than these translations by Trevisa. But in quite modern times, an
excellent example of it has appeared, viz. in the <i>Poems of Rural
Life, in the Dorset Dialect</i>, by William Barnes.</p>

<h2>THE SOUTHERN DIALECT OF KENT</h2>

<p>Though the Kentish dialect properly belongs to Southern English, from
its position to the south of the Thames, yet it shows certain
peculiarities which make it desirable to consider it apart from the
rest.</p>

<p>In Beda’s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>,
Bk <span class = "smallcaps">i</span>, ch. 15, he says of the
Teutonic invaders: “Those who came over were of the three most
powerful nations of Germany&mdash;Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. From the Jutes
are descended the people of Kent, and of the Isle of Wight, and those
also in the province of the West-Saxons who are to this day called
Jutes, seated opposite to the Isle of Wight”; a remark which obviously
implies the southern part of Hampshire. This suggests that the speech
of Kent, from the very first, had peculiarities of its own. Dr Sweet,
in his <i>Second Anglo-Saxon Reader, Archaic and Dialectal</i>, gives
five very brief Kentish charters of the seventh and eighth centuries,
but the texts are in Latin, and only the names of persons and places
appear in Kentish forms. In the ninth century, however, there
<a name = "page57"> </a><span class = "pagenum">57</span>
are seven Kentish charters, of a fuller description, from the
year 805 to 837. In one of these, dated 835, a few lines occur that
may be quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
Ic bidde and bebeode swælc monn se thæt min lond hebbe thæt he ælce
gere agefe them higum æt Folcanstane l. ambra maltes, and vi. ambra

and vi. scep.... Thæm higum et Cristes cirican of thæm londe et
Cealflocan: thæt is thonne thritig ombra alath, and threo hund hlafa,

hennfuglas, thritig teapera, gif hit wintres deg sie, sester fulne
huniges, sester fulne butran, sester fulne saltes.
</blockquote>

<p>That is to say:</p>

<blockquote>
I ask and command, whosoever may have my land, that he every year give
to the domestics at Folkestone fifty measures of malt, and six
measures of meal, and three weys [<i>heavy weights</i>] of bacon and
cheese, and four hundred loaves, and one rother [<i>ox</i>], and six
sheep.... To the domestics at Christ’s church, from the land at
Challock: that is, then, thirty vessels of ale, and three hundred
loaves, of which fifty shall be white loaves, one wey of bacon and
cheese, one old rother, four wethers, one swine or six wethers, six
goose-fowls, ten hen-fowls, thirty tapers, if it be a day in winter, a
jar full of honey, a jar full of butter, and a jar full of salt.
</blockquote>

<p>At pp. 152-175 of the same volume, Dr Sweet gives 1204 Kentish glosses
of a very early date. No. 268 is: “<i>Cardines</i>, hearran”; and in
several modern dialects, including Hampshire, the upright part of a
gate to which the hinges are fastened is called a <i>harr</i>.</p>

<p>Several years ago, M. Paul Mayer found five short sermons in a Kentish
dialect in MS. Laud 471, in the Bodleian Library, along with their
French originals. They are printed in Morris’s <i>Old English
Miscellany</i>, and two of them will be found in <i>Specimens of Early
English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">i</span>, p. 141.
The former of these is for the Epiphany,
the text being taken from Matt. ii 1. The date is just before 1250.
I give an extract.</p>

<blockquote>
The kinges hem wenten and hi seghen the sterre thet yede bifore hem,
alwat hi kam over tho huse war ure loverd was; and alswo hi hedden
i-fonden ure loverd, swo hin an-urede, and him offrede hire offrendes,
gold, and stor, and mirre. Tho nicht efter thet aperede an ongel of
hevene in here slepe ine metinge, and hem seide and het, thet hi ne
solde ayen wende be herodes, ac be an other weye wende into hire
londes.
</blockquote>

<p>That is:</p>

<blockquote>
The kings went (them), and they saw the star that went before them
until it came over the house where our Lord was; and as-soon-as they
had found our Lord, so (they) honoured him, and offered him their
offerings, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. The night after that
(there) appeared an angel from heaven in their sleep, in a dream, and
said to-them and commanded, that they should not wend again near
Herod, but by another way wend to their lands.
</blockquote>

<p>In the days of Edward II (1307-27) flourished William of Shoreham,
named from Shoreham (Kent), near Otford and Sevenoaks, who was
appointed vicar of Chart-Sutton in 1320. He translated the Psalter
<a name = "page59"> </a><span class = "pagenum">59</span> into English prose,
and wrote some religious poems, chiefly
relating to church-services, which were edited by T. Wright for the
Percy Society in 1849. His poem “On Baptism” is printed in
<i>Specimens of Early English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>.

<p>In the year 1340, Dan Michel of Northgate (Kent) translated into
English a French treatise on Vices and Virtues, under the title <i>The
Ayenbite of Inwyt</i>, literally, “The Again-biting of In-wit,” i.e.
Remorse of Conscience. This is the best specimen of the Kentish
dialect of the fourteenth century, and is
<a name = "page60"> </a><span class = "pagenum">60</span>
remarkable for being much more difficult to make out than other pieces
of the same period. The whole work was edited by Dr Morris for the
Early English Text Society in 1866. A sermon of the same date and in
the same dialect, and probably by the same author, is given in
<i>Specimens of Early English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>.
The sermon is followed by
the Lord’s Prayer, the Ave Maria, and the “Credo” or Apostles’ Creed,
all in the same dialect; and I here give the last of these, as being
not difficult to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
Ich leve ine God, Vader almighti, makere of hevene and of erthe. And
ine Iesu Crist, His zone onlepi [<i>only son</i>], oure lhord, thet
y-kend [<i>conceived</i>] is of the Holy Gost, y-bore of Marie
mayde, y-pyned [<i>was crucified</i>, lit. <i>made to suffer</i>] onder Pouns

[<i>went</i>] doun to helle; thane thridde day aros vram the dyade;

holy-ones</i>]; Lesnesse of zennes [<i>remission of sins</i>]; of
vlesse [<i>flesh, body</i>] arizinge; and lyf evrelestinde. Zuo by hyt
[<i>so be it</i>].
</blockquote>

<p>A few remarks may well be made here on some of the peculiarities of
Southern English that appear here. The use of <i>v</i> for <i>f</i>
(as in <i>vader</i>, <i>vram</i>, <i>vlesshe</i>), and of <i>z</i> for
<i>s</i> (as in <i>zone</i>, <i>zit</i>, <i>zennes</i>) are common to
this day, especially in Somersetshire. The spelling <i>lhord</i>
reminds us that many Anglo-Saxon words began with <i>hl</i>, one of
them being <i>hlāfweard</i>, later <i>hlāford</i>,
<a name = "page61"> </a><span class = "pagenum">61</span>
a lord; and this <i>hl</i> is a symbol denoting the so-called “whispered
<i>l</i>,” sounded much as if an aspirate were prefixed to the
<i>l</i>, and still common in Welsh, where it is denoted by <i>ll</i>,
as in <i>llyn</i>, a lake. In every case, modern English substitutes
for it the ordinary <i>l</i>, though <i>lh</i> (= <i>hl</i>) was in
use in 1340 in Southern. The prefix <i>y-</i>, representing the
extremely common A.S. (Anglo-Saxon) prefix <i>ge-</i>, was kept up in
Southern much longer than in the other dialects, but has now
disappeared; the form <i>y-clept</i> being archaic. The plural suffix
<i>-en</i>, as in <i>haly-en</i>, holy ones, saints, is due to the
fact that Southern admitted the use of that suffix very freely, as in
<i>cherch-en</i>, churches, <i>sterr-en</i>, stars, etc.; whilst
Northern only admitted five such plurals, viz. <i>egh-en</i>, <i>ey-en</i>,
eyes (Shakespeare’s <i>eyne</i>), <i>hos-en</i>, stockings,
<i>ox-en</i>, <i>shoo-n</i>, shoes, and <i>fā-n</i>, foes; <i>ox-en</i>
being the sole survivor, since <i>shoon</i> (as in
<i>Hamlet</i>, <span class = "smallcaps">iv</span> iv 26) is archaic.
The modern <i>child-r-en</i>,
<i>breth-r-en</i>, are really double plurals; Northern employed the
more original forms <i>childer</i> and <i>brether</i>, both of which,
and especially the former, are still in dialectal use. <i>Evrelest-inde</i>
exhibits the Southern <i>-inde</i> for present participles.</p>

<p>But the word <i>zennes</i>, sins, exhibits a peculiarity that is
almost solely Kentish, and seldom found elsewhere, viz. the use of
<i>e</i> for <i>i</i>. The explanation of this rests on an elementary
lesson in Old English phonology, which it will do the reader no harm
to
<a name = "page62"> </a><span class = "pagenum">62</span>
acquire. The modern symbol <i>i</i> (when denoting the
<i>short</i> sound, as in <i>pit</i>) really does double duty. It
sometimes represents the A.S. short <i>i</i>, as in <i>it</i> (A.S.
<i>hit</i>), <i>sit</i> (A.S. <i>sittan</i>), <i>bitten</i> (A.S.
<i>bĭten</i>), etc.; and sometimes the A.S. short <i>y</i>, as in
<i>pyt</i>, a pit. The sound of the A.S. short <i>i</i> was much the
same as in modern English; but that of the short <i>y</i> was
different, as it denoted the “mutated” form of short <i>u</i> for
which German has a special symbol, viz. <i>ü</i>, the sound intended
being that of the German <i>ü</i> in <i>schützen</i>, to protect. In
the latter case, Kentish usually has the vowel <i>e</i>, as in the
modern Kentish <i>pet</i>, a pit, and in the surname <i>Petman</i> (at
Margate), which means <i>pitman</i>; and as the A.S. for “sin” was
<i>synn</i> (dat. <i>synne</i>), the Kentish form was <i>zenne</i>,
since Middle English substantives often represent the A.S. dative
case. The Kentish plural had the double form, <i>zennes</i> and
<i>zennen</i>, both of which occur in the <i>Ayenbite</i>, as might
have been expected.</p>

<p>The poet Gower, who completed what may be called the first edition of
his poem named the <i>Confessio Amantis</i> (or Confession of a Lover)
in 1390, was a Kentish man, and well acquainted with the Kentish
dialect. He took advantage of this to introduce, occasionally, Kentish
forms into his verse; apparently for the sake of securing a rime more
easily. See this discussed at p. ci of vol.
<span class = "smallcaps">ii</span> of Macaulay’s edition
of Gower. I may illustrate this
<a name = "page63"> </a><span class = "pagenum">63</span>
by noting that in <i>Conf.
Amant.</i> i 1908, we find <i>pitt</i> riming with <i>witt</i>,
whereas in the same, v 4945, <i>pet</i> rimes with <i>let</i>.</p>

<p>We know that, in 1386, the poet Chaucer was elected a knight of the
shire for Kent, and in 1392-3 he was residing at Greenwich. He
evidently knew something of the Kentish dialect; and he took advantage
of the circumstance, precisely as Gower did, for varying his rimes.
The earliest example of this is in his <i>Book of the Duchess</i>, l.
438, where he uses the Kentish <i>ken</i> instead of <i>kin</i> (A.S.
<i>cynn</i>) in order to secure a rime for <i>ten</i>. In the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, E 1057, he has <i>kesse</i>, to kiss (A.S.
<i>cyssan</i>), to rime with <i>stedfastnesse</i>. In the same, A
1318, he has <i>fulfille</i>, to fulfil (cf. A.S. <i>fyllan</i>, to
fill), to rime with <i>wille</i>; but in Troilus, iii 510, he changes
it to <i>fulfelle</i>, to rime with <i>telle</i>; with several other
instances of a like kind.</p>

<p>It is further remarkable that some Kentish forms seem to have
established themselves in standard English, as when we use <i>dent</i>
with the sense of <i>dint</i> (A.S. <i>dynt</i>). When we speak of
<i>the left hand</i>, the form <i>left</i> is really Kentish, and
occurs in the <i>Ayenbite of Inwyt</i>; the Midland form is properly
<i>lift</i>, which is common enough in Middle English; see the <i>New
English Dictionary</i>, s.v. <i>Left</i>, adj. <i>Hemlock</i> is
certainly a Kentish form; cf. A.S. <i>hymlice</i>, and see the <i>New
English Dictionary</i>. So also is <i>kernel</i> (A.S. <i>cyrnel</i>);
<a name = "page64"> </a><span class = "pagenum">64</span> <i>knell</i>
(A.S. <i>cnyllan</i>, verb); <i>merry</i> (A.S.
<i>myrge</i>, <i>myrige</i>); and perhaps <i>stern</i>, adj. (A.S.
<i>styrne</i>).</p>

<p>There are some excellent remarks upon the vocalism of the Kentish
dialect in Middle English by W. Heuser, in the German periodical
entitled <i>Anglia</i>, vol <span class = "smallcaps">xvii</span> pp. 73-90.</p>

<h2>THE MERCIAN DIALECT</h2>

<h3><a name = "chapVIII_I">I. East Midland</a></h3>

<p>The Mercian district lies between the Northern and Southern, occupying
an irregular area which it is very difficult to define. On the east
coast it reached from the mouth of the Humber to that of the Thames.
On the western side it seems to have included a part of Lancashire,
and extended from the mouth of the Lune to the Bristol Channel,
exclusive of a great part of Wales.</p>

<p>There were two chief varieties of it which differed in many
particulars, viz. the East Midland and the West Midland. The East
Midland included, roughly speaking, the counties of Lincoln, Rutland,
Northampton, and Buckingham, and all the counties (between the Thames
and Humber) to the east of these, viz. Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford,
Hertford, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex. We must also
certainly include, if not Oxfordshire, at any rate the city of Oxford.
This is by far the most important
<a name = "page66"> </a><span class = "pagenum">66</span>
group of counties, as it was
the East Midland that finally prevailed over the rest, and was at last
accepted as a standard, thus rising from the position of a dialect to
be the language of the Empire. The Midland prevailed over the Northern
and Southern dialects because it was intermediate between them, and so
helped to interpret between North and South; and the East Midland
prevailed over the Western because it contained within its area all
three of the chief literary centres, namely, Oxford, Cambridge, and
London. It follows from this that the Old Mercian dialect is of
greater interest than either the Northumbrian or Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the amount of extant Old Mercian, before the Conquest,
is not very large, and it is only of late years that the MSS.
containing it have been rightly understood. Practically, the study of
it dates only from 1885, when Dr Sweet published his <i>Oldest English
Texts</i>.</p>

<p>But there is more Mercian to be found than was at first suspected; and
it is desirable to consider this question.</p>

<p>An important discovery was that the language of the oldest Glossaries
seems to be Mercian. We have extant no less than four Glossaries in
MSS. of as early a date as the eighth century, named respectively, the
Epinal, Erfurt, Corpus, and Leyden Glossaries. The first is now at
Epinal, in France (in the department
<a name = "page67"> </a><span class = "pagenum">67</span>
Vosges); the second, at
Erfurt, near Weimar, in Germany; the third, in Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge; and the fourth, at Leyden, in Holland. The Corpus MS. may
be taken as typical of the rest. It contains an enumeration of a large
number of difficult words, arranged, but imperfectly, in alphabetical
order; and after each of these is written its gloss or interpretation.
Thus the fifth folio begins as follows:</p>

<table summary="" align = "center">
<tr>
<td>
Abminiculum . adiutorium.&emsp;<br>
Abelena . haeselhnutu.<br>
Abiecit . proiecit.
</td>
<td>
Absida . sacrarium.&emsp;<br>
Abies . etspe.<br>
Ab ineunte ætate . infantia.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The chief interest of these Glossaries lies in the fact that a small
proportion of the hard words is explained, not in Latin, but in
Mercian English, of which there are two examples in the six glosses
here quoted. Thus Abelena, which is another spelling of Abellana or
Avellana, “a filbert,” is explained as “haeselhnutu”; which is a
perfectly familiar word when reduced to its modern form of “hazel-nut.”
And again, Abies, which usually means “a fir-tree,” is here
glossed by “etspe.” But this is certainly a false spelling, as we see
by comparing it with the following glosses in Epinal and Erfurt (Nos.
37,1006):&mdash;“Abies. saeppae&mdash;sæpae”; and “Tremulus. aespae&mdash;espæ.” This
shows that the scribe ought to have explained Abies by “saeppae,”
meaning the tree full of sap, called in French <i>sapin</i>; but he
confused it with
<a name = "page68"> </a><span class = "pagenum">68</span>
another tree, the “trembling” tree, of which
the Old Mercian name was “espe” or “espæ,” or “aespae,” and he
miswrote <i>espe</i> as <i>etspe</i>, inserting a needless <i>t</i>.
This last tree is the one which Chaucer called the <i>asp</i> in l.
180 of his <i>Parliament of Fowls</i>, but in modern times the
adjectival suffix <i>-en</i> (as in <i>gold-en</i>, <i>wood-en</i>)
has been tacked on to it, and it is now the <i>aspen</i>.</p>

<p>The interpretation of these ancient glosses requires very great care,
but they afford a considerable number of interesting results, and are
therefore valuable, especially as they give us spellings of the eighth
century, which are very scarce.</p>

<p>One of the oldest specimens of Old Mercian that affords intelligible
sentences is known as the “Lorica Prayer,” because it occurs in the
same MS. (Ll. 1. 10 in the Cambridge University Library) as the
“Lorica Glosses,” or the glosses which accompany a long Latin prayer,
really a charm, called “lorica” or “breast-plate,” because it was
recited thrice a day to protect the person who used it from all
possible injury and accident. I give this Prayer as illustrating the
state of our language about A.D. 850.</p>

And earnestly pray for-thyself for help and mercy by-reason-of the
deeds and merits and prayers of all his saints on-behalf-of the

then, at the fourth time, thy face thrice to the earth before all
God’s church, and sing these verses: The Lord is my salvation, save
Thy people, O Lord: show forth Thy mercy. Sing then a pater-noster.
Pray then for all believing men in the world. Then shalt thou be, on
that day, a partaker, by God’s grace, of all the good things that any
man doth for His name, and all true-men will intercede for thee in
heaven and in earth. Amen.
</blockquote>

<p>Another discovery was the assignment of a correct description to the
glosses found in a document known as the <i>Vespasian Psalter</i>; so
called because it is an early Latin Psalter, or book of Psalms,
contained in a Cotton MS. in the British Museum, marked with the
class-mark “Vespasian, A. 1.” This Psalter is accompanied throughout
with glosses which were at first mistakenly thought to be in a
Northumbrian dialect, and were published as such by the Surtees
Society in 1843. They were next, in 1875, wrongly supposed to be
Kentish; but since they were printed by Sweet in 1885 it has been
shown that they are really
<a name = "page70"> </a><span class = "pagenum">70</span>
Mercian. This set of glosses is very important for the study of
Old Mercian, because they are rather extensive; they occupy 213 pages
of the <i>Oldest English Texts</i>, and are followed by 20 more pages
of similar glosses to certain Latin canticles and hymns that occur in
the same MS.</p>

<p>There are also a few Charters extant in the Mercian dialect, but the
earliest contain little else than old forms of the names of persons
and places. There are, however, some later Charters, from 836 to 1058
in the Mercian dialect, which contain some boundaries of lands and
afford other information. Most of these relate to Worcestershire.</p>

<p>But the most interesting Mercian glosses are those to be found in the
Rushworth MS., which has already been mentioned as containing
Northumbrian glosses of the Latin Gospels of St Mark, St Luke, and St
John. For the Gospel of St Matthew was glossed by the scribe Farman,
who was a priest of Harewood, situate on the river Wharfe, in the West
Riding of Yorkshire; whose language, accordingly, was Mercian. In my
<i>Principles of English Etymology, First Series</i> (second edition,
1892), p. 44, I gave a list of words selected from these glosses, in
order to show how much nearer they stand, as a rule, to modern English
than do the corresponding Anglo-Saxon forms. I here repeat this list,
as it is very instructive. The references, such as “5. 15,” are to
<a name = "page71"> </a><span class = "pagenum">71</span>
the chapters and verses of St Matthew’s Gospel, as printed in
my edition of <i>The Holy Gospels, in Anglo-Saxon, Northumbrian, and
Old Mercian Versions, synoptically arranged</i> (Cambridge, 1871-87).
The first column below gives the Modern English form, the second the
Old Mercian form (with references), and the third the Anglo-Saxon or
Wessex form:</p>

<p>In l.5, the scribe Farman miswrote <i>caldas</i> as <i>galdas</i>, in
Matt. x 42; but it is a mere mistake. In l. 20, the accent over the
<i>a</i> in <i>áld</i> is marked in the MS., though the vowel was not
originally long.</p>

<p>Even a glance at this comparative table reveals a peculiarity of the
Wessex dialect which properly belongs neither to Mercian nor to Modern
English, viz. the use of the diphthong <i>ea</i> (in which each vowel
was pronounced separately) instead of simple <i>a</i>, before the
sounds denoted by <i>l</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>h</i>, especially when
another consonant follows. We find accordingly such Wessex forms as
<i>eall</i>, <i>ceald</i>, <i>fealleth</i>, <i>-feald</i>,
<i>gealla</i>, <i>healf</i>, <i>healt</i>, <i>nearu</i>, <i>eald</i>,
<i>seald</i>, <i>weall</i>, <i>gearo</i>, where the Old Mercian has
simply <i>all</i>, <i>cald</i>, <i>falleth</i>, <i>-fald</i>,
<i>galla</i>, <i>half</i>, <i>halt</i>, <i>naru</i>, <i>ald</i>,
<i>sald</i>, <i>wall</i>, <i>iara</i>. Similarly, Wessex has the
diphthongs <i>ēa</i>, <i>ēo</i>, in which the former element is
long, where the Old Mercian has simply <i>ē</i> or <i>ī</i>. We
find accordingly the Wessex <i>cēace</i>, <i>ēac</i>,
<i>ēage</i>, <i>scēap</i>, as against the Mercian
<i>cēke</i>, <i>ēk</i>, <i>ēge</i>, <i>scēp</i>; and the
Wessex <i>lēogan</i>, <i>lēoht</i>, as against the Mercian
<i>līgan</i>, <i>līht</i>.</p>

<p>I have now mentioned nearly all the examples of Old Mercian to
be found before the Conquest. After that event it was still the
Southern dialect that prevailed, and there is scarcely any Mercian (or
Midland) to be found except in the Laud MS. of the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>, which was written at Peterborough. See the extract,
describing the miserable state of England during the reign of Stephen,
in <i>Specimens of Early English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">i</span>.</p>

<p>It was about the year 1200 that the remarkable work appeared that is
known by the name of <i>The Ormulum</i>, written in the North-East
Midland of Lincolnshire, which is the first clear example of the form
which our literary language was destined to assume. It is an extremely
long and dreary poem of about 10,000 long lines, written in a sadly
monotonous unrimed metre; and it contains an introduction, paraphrases
relating to the gospels read in the church during the year, and
homilies upon the same. It was named <i>Ormulum</i> by the author
after his own name, which was Orm; and the sole existing MS. is
probably in the handwriting of Orm himself, who employed a phonetic
spelling of his own invention which he strongly recommends. Owing to
this circumstance and to the fact that his very regular metre leaves
no doubt as to his grammatical forms, this otherwise uninviting poem
has a high philological value. In my book entitled <i>The Chaucer
Canon</i>, published at
<a name = "page74"> </a><span class = "pagenum">74</span>
Oxford in 1900, I quote 78 long lines
from the <i>Ormulum</i>, reduced to a simpler system of spelling, at
pp. 9-14; and, at pp. 15-18,I give an analysis of the suffixes
employed by Orm to mark grammatical inflexions. At pp. 30-41, I give
an analysis of similar inflexions as employed by Chaucer, who likewise
employed the East Midland dialect, but with such slight modifications
of Orm’s language as were due to his living in London instead of
Lincolnshire, and to the fact that he wrote more than 150 years later.
The agreement, as to grammatical usages, of these two authors is
extremely close, allowing for lapse of time; and the comparison
between them gives most indubitable and valuable results. There is no
better way of learning Chaucer’s grammar.</p>

<p>As East Midland was spread over a wide area, there are, as might be
expected, some varieties of it. The dialects of Lincolnshire and of
Norfolk were not quite the same, and both differed somewhat from that
of Essex and Middlesex; but the general characteristics of all three
sub-dialects are very much alike. As time went on, the speech of the
students of Oxford and Cambridge was closely assimilated to that of
the court as held in London; and this “educated” type was naturally
that to which Caxton and the great writers of the sixteenth century
endeavoured to conform.</p>

<p>We have one ancient specimen of the London
<a name = "page75"> </a><span class = "pagenum">75</span>
dialect which is
eminently authentic and valuable, and has the additional advantage of
being exactly dated. This is the document known as “The only English
Proclamation of Henry III,” issued on Oct. 18, 1258. Its intention was
to confirm to the people the “Provisions of Oxford,” a charter of
rights that had been wrested from the king, from which we may conclude
that the Proclamation was issued by Henry rather by compulsion than by
his own free will. There is a note at the end which tells us that a
copy was sent to every shire in England and to Ireland. If every copy
had been preserved, we should have a plentiful supply. As it is, only
two copies have survived. One is the copy which found its way to
Oxford; and the other is the original from which the copies were made,
which has been carefully preserved for six centuries and a half in the
Public Record Office in London. I here give the contents of the
original, substituting <i>y</i> (at the beginning of a word) or
<i>gh</i> (elsewhere) for the symbol <i>ȝ</i>, and <i>th</i> for the symbol
<i>þ</i>, and <i>v</i> for <i>u</i> when between two vowels.</p>

<p>This document presents at first sight many
<a name = "page77"> </a><span class = "pagenum">77</span>
unfamiliar forms, but
really differs from Modern English mainly in the spelling, which of
course represents the pronunciation of that period. The grammar is
perfectly intelligible, and this is the surest mark of similarity of
language; we may, however, note the use of <i>send</i> as a
contraction of <i>sendeth</i>, and of <i>oni</i> for “any man” in the
singular, while <i>onie</i>, being plural, represents “any men.”</p>

<p>The other chief variations are in the vocabulary or word-list, due to
the fact that this Proclamation is older than the reigns of the first
three Edwards, which was the period when so many words of Anglo-Norman
origin entered our language, displacing many words of native origin
that thus became obsolete; though some were exchanged for other
<i>native</i> words. We may notice, for example, <i>fultume</i>,
“assistance”; <i>holde</i>, “faithful”; <i>ilærde and ileawede</i>,
“learned and unlearned”; <i>unnen</i>, “grant”; <i>rædesmen</i>,
“councillors”; <i>kuneriche</i>, “kingdom”; and so on. I subjoin a
closely literal translation, retaining awkward expressions.</p>

<p>In the year 1303, Robert Manning, of Bourn in Lincolnshire, translated
a French poem entitled <i>Manuel des Pechiez</i> (Manual of Sins) into
very fair East Midland verse, giving to his translation the title of
<i>Handling Synne</i>. Many of the verses are easy and smooth, and the
poem clearly shows us that the East Midland dialect was by this time
at least the equal of the others, and that the language was good
enough to be largely permanent. When we read such lines as:</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Than seyd echone that sate and stode,<br>
Here comth Pers, that never dyd gode&mdash;
</div>

<a name = "page79"> </a><span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<p>we have merely to modernise the spelling, and we at once have:</p>

<div class = "verse1">
Then said each one that sat and stood,<br>
Here cometh Pierce, that never did good,
</div>

<p>These are lines that could be written now.</p>

<p>An extract from Manning’s <i>Handlyng Synne</i> is given in
<i>Specimens of Early English</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>,
most of which can be read
with ease. The obsolete words are not very numerous, and we meet now
and then with half a dozen consecutive lines that would puzzle no one.
It is needless to pursue the history of this dialect further. It had,
by this time, become almost the standard language, differing from
Modern English chiefly in date, and consequently in pronunciation. We
pass on from Manning to Chaucer, from Chaucer to Lydgate and Caxton,
and from Caxton to Lord Surrey and Sackville and Spenser, without any
real change in the actual dialect employed, but only in the form of
it.</p>


<h3><a name = "chapVIII_II">II. West Midland</a></h3>

<p>We have seen that there are two divisions of the Mercian dialect, into
East and West Midland.</p>

<p>The West Midland does not greatly differ from the East Midland, but it
approaches more nearly, in some respects, to the Northumbrian. The
greatest
<a name = "page80"> </a><span class = "pagenum">80</span>
distinction seems to be in the present and past
participles of verbs. In the West Midland, the present participle
frequently ends in <i>-and</i>, as in Northumbrian, especially in the
Northern part of the Midland area. The East Midland usually employs
<i>-ende</i> or <i>-inge</i> instead. In the West Midland, the prefix
<i>i-</i> or <i>y-</i> is seldom used for the past participle, whilst
the East Midland admits it more freely. In the third person singular
of the present tense, the West Midland favours the Northern suffix
<i>-es</i> or <i>-is</i>; whilst the East Midland favours the Southern
suffix <i>-eth</i>. The suffix <i>-us</i> appears to be altogether
peculiar to West Midland, in which it occurs occasionally; and the
same is true of <i>-ud</i> for <i>-ed</i> in the preterite of a weak
verb.</p>

<p>There is a rather early West Midland <i>Prose Psalter</i>, belonging
to the former half of the fourteenth century, which was edited for the
Early English Text Society by Dr Karl Bulbring in 1891.</p>

<p>The curious poem called <i>William of Palerne</i> (Palermo) or
<i>William and the Werwolf</i>, written in alliterative verse about
1350-60, and edited by me for the E.E.T.S. in 1867, seems to be in a
form of West Midland, and has been claimed for Shropshire; nothing is
known as to its author.</p>

<p>The very remarkable poem called <i>The Pearl</i>, and three
<i>Alliterative Poems</i> by the same author, were first edited by Dr
Morris for the E.E.T.S. in 1864; with a preface in which the
peculiarities of the dialect
<a name = "page81"> </a><span class = "pagenum">81</span>
were discussed. Dr Morris showed
that the grammatical forms are uniform and consistent throughout, and
may be safely characterised as being West Midland. Moreover, they are
frequently very like Northumbrian, and must belong to the Northern
area of the West Midland dialect. “Much,” says Dr Morris, “may be said
in favour of their Lancashire origin.”</p>

<p>The MS. which contains the above poems also contains the excellent
alliterative romance-poem named <i>Sir Gawayne and the Green
Knight</i>, evidently written by the same author; so that this poem
also may be considered as a specimen of West Midland. For further
particulars, see the “Grammatical Details” given in Dr Morris’s
preface to <i>The Pearl</i>, etc., pp. xxviii-xl. <i>Sir Gawayne</i>
was likewise edited by Morris in 1864.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to trace the history of this dialect at a later
date, and the task is hardly necessary. It was soon superseded in
literary use by the East Midland, with which it had much in common.</p>

<h1><a name = "chapIX">CHAPTER IX</a></h1>

<h2>FOREIGN ELEMENTS IN THE DIALECTS</h2>

<p>There is a widely prevalent notion that the speakers of English
Dialects employ none but native words; and it is not uncommon for
writers who have more regard for picturesque effect than for accuracy
to enlarge upon this theme, and to praise the dialects at the expense
of the literary language. Of course there is a certain amount of truth
in this, but it would be better to look into the matter a little more
closely.</p>

<p>A very little reflection will show that dialect-speakers have always
been in contact with some at least of those who employ words that
belong rather, or once belonged, to foreign nations. Even shopkeepers
are familiar with such words as <i>beef</i>, <i>mutton</i>,
<i>broccoli</i>, <i>soda</i>, <i>cork</i>, <i>sherry</i>,
<i>brandy</i>, <i>tea</i>, <i>coffee</i>, <i>sugar</i>, <i>sago</i>,
and many more such words that are now quite familiar to every one. Yet
<i>beef</i> and <i>mutton</i> are Norman; <i>broccoli</i> and
<i>soda</i> are Italian; <i>cork</i> and <i>sherry</i> are Spanish;
<i>brandy</i> is Dutch; <i>tea</i> is Chinese; <i>coffee</i> is
Arabic; <i>sugar</i> is of Sanskrit origin; and
<a name = "page83"> </a><span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<i>sago</i> is
Malay. It must be evident that many similar words, having reference to
very various useful things, have long ago drifted into the dialects
from the literary language. Hence the purity of the dialects from
contamination with foreign influences is merely comparative, not
absolute.</p>

<p>Our modern language abounds with words borrowed from many foreign
tongues; but a large number of them have come to us since 1500. Before
that date the chief languages from which it was possible for us to
borrow words were British or Gaelic, Irish, Latin, Greek (invariably
through the medium of Latin), Hebrew (in a small degree, through the
medium of Latin), Arabic (very slightly, and indirectly),
Scandinavian, and French. A few words as to most of these are
sufficient.</p>

<p>It is not long since a great parade was made of our borrowings from
“Celtic”; it was very easy to give a wild guess that an obscure word
was “Celtic”; and the hardihood of the guesser was often made to take
the place of evidence. The fact is that there is no such language as
“Celtic”; it is the name of a group of languages, including “British”
or Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Manx, Gaelic, and Irish; and it is now
incumbent on the etymologist to cite the exact forms in one or more of
these on which he relies, so as to adduce some semblance of proof. The
result has been an extraordinary shrinkage in the number
<a name = "page84"> </a><span class = "pagenum">84</span>
of
alleged Celtic words. The number, in fact, is extremely small, except
in special cases. Thus we may expect to find a few Welsh words in the
dialects of Cheshire, Shropshire, or Herefordshire, on the Welsh
border; and a certain proportion of Gaelic words in Lowland Scotch;
though we have no reliable lists of these, and it is remarkable that
such words have usually been borrowed at no very early date, and
sometimes quite recently. The legacy of words bequeathed to us by the
ancient Britons is surprisingly small; indeed, it is very difficult to
point to many clear cases. The question is considered in my
<i>Principles of English Etymology, Series I</i>, pp. 443-452, to
which I may refer the reader; and a list of words of (probably) Celtic
origin is given in my larger <i>Etymological Dictionary</i>, ed. 1910,
p. 765. It is also explained, in my <i>Primer of English Etymology</i>
that, in the fifth century, the time of Hengist’s invasion, “the
common language of the more educated classes among the British was
Latin, which was in use as a literary language and as the language of
the British Christian Church. Hence, the Low German tribes [of
invaders] found no great necessity for learning ancient British; and
this explains the fact, which would otherwise be extraordinary, that
modern English contains but a very small Celtic element.” Of the Celts
that remained within the English pale, it is certain that, in a very
short time, they accepted
<a name = "page85"> </a><span class = "pagenum">85</span>
the necessity of learning Anglian or
Saxon, and lost their previous language altogether. Hence, in many
dialects, as for example, in the East Midland district, the amount of
words of “British” origin is practically <i>nil</i>. For further
remarks on this subject, see Chapter <span class = "smallcaps">v</span>
of <i>Anglo-Saxon Britain</i>,
by Grant Allen, London, n.d.</p>

<p>I here give a tentative list of some Celtic words found in dialects.
Their etymologies are discussed in my <i>Etymological Dictionary</i>
(1910), as they are also found in literary use; and the words are
fully explained in the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>, which gives
all their senses, and enumerates the counties in which they are found.
It is doubtless imperfect, as I give only words that are mostly well
known, and can be found, indeed, in the <i>New English Dictionary</i>.
I give only one sense of each, and mark it as N., M., or S. (Northern,
Midland, or Southern), as the case may be. The symbol “gen.” means
“in general use”; and “Sc.” means Lowland Scotch.</p>

<p>Latin is a language from which English has
<a name = "page87"> </a><span class = "pagenum">87</span>
borrowed words in
every century since the year 600. In my <i>Principles of English
Etymology, First Series</i>, Chap. <span class = "smallcaps">xxi</span>,
I give a list of Latin words
imported into English before the Norman Conquest. Several of these
must be familiar in our dialects; we can hardly suppose that country
people do not know the meaning of ark, beet, box, candle, chalk,
cheese, cook, coulter, cup, fennel, fever, font, fork, inch, kettle,
kiln, kitchen, and the like. Indeed, <i>ark</i> is quite a favourite
word in the North for a large wooden chest, used for many purposes;
and Kersey explains it as “a country word for a large chest to put
fruit or corn in.” <i>Candle</i> is so common that it is frequently
reduced to <i>cannel</i>; and it has given its name to “cannel coal.”
Every countryman is expected to be able to distinguish “between chalk
and cheese.” <i>Coulter</i> appears in ten dialect forms, and one of
the most familiar agricultural implements is a pitch-<i>fork</i>. The
influence of Latin requires no further illustration.</p>

<p>I also give a list of early words of Greek origin; some of which are
likewise in familiar use. I may instance alms, angel, bishop, butter,
capon, chest, church, clerk, copper, devil, dish, hemp, imp, martyr,
paper (ultimately of Egyptian origin), plaster, plum, priest, rose,
sack, school, silk, treacle, trout. Of course the poor old woman who
says she is “a martyr to tooth-ache” is quite unconscious that she is
talking Greek. Probably she is not without some smattering of
<a name = "page88"> </a><span class = "pagenum">88</span>

Persian, and knows the sense of lilac, myrtle, orange, peach, and
rice; of Sanskrit, whence pepper and sugar-candy; of Arabic, whence
coffee, cotton, jar, mattress, senna, and sofa; and she will know
enough Hebrew, partly from her Bible, to be quite familiar with a
large number of biblical names, such as Adam and Abraham and Isaac,
and very many more, not forgetting the very common John, Joseph,
Matthew, and Thomas, and the still more familiar Jack and Jockey; and
even with a few words of Hebrew origin, such as alleluia, balm,
bedlam, camel, cider, and sabbath. The discovery of the New World has
further familiarised us all with chocolate and tomato, which are
Mexican; and with potato, which is probably old Caribbean. These facts
have to be borne in mind when it is too rashly laid down that words in
English dialects are of English origin.</p>

<p>Foreign words of this kind are, however, not very numerous, and can
easily be allowed for. And, as has been said, our vocabulary admits
also of a certain amount of Celtic. It remains to consider what other
sources have helped to form our dialects. The two most prolific in
this respect are Scandinavian and French, which require careful
consideration.</p>

<p>It is notorious that the Northern dialect admits Scandinavian words
freely; and the same is true, to a lesser degree, of East Midland.
They are rare in Southern, and in the Southern part of West Midland.
<a name = "page89"> </a><span class = "pagenum">89</span> The constant
invasions of the Danes, and the subjection of
England under the rule of three Danish kings, Canute and his two
successors, have very materially increased our vocabulary; and it is
remarkable that they have perhaps done more for our dialects than for
the standard language. The ascendancy of Danish rule was in the
eleventh century; but (with a few exceptions) it was long before words
which must really have been introduced at that time began to appear in
our literature. They must certainly have been looked upon, at the
first, as being rustic or dialectal. I have nowhere seen it remarked,
and I therefore call attention to the fact, that a certain note of
rustic origin still clings to many words of this class; and I would
instance such as these: bawl, bloated, blunder, bungle, clog, clown,
clumsy, to cow, to craze, dowdy, dregs, dump, and many more of a like
character. I do not say that such words cannot be employed in serious
literature; but they require skillful handling.</p>

<p>For further information, see the chapter on “The Scandinavian Element
in English,” in my <i>Principles of English Etymology, Series I</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to dialectal Scandinavian, see the List of English Words,
as compared with Icelandic, in my Appendix to Cleasby and Vigfusson’s
<i>Icelandic Dictionary</i>. In this long list, filling 80 columns,
the dialectal words are marked with a dagger †. But
<a name = "page90"> </a><span class = "pagenum">90</span>
the list
of these is by no means exhaustive, and it will require a careful
search through the pages of the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> to
do justice to the wealth of this Old Norse element. There is an
excellent article on this subject by Arnold Wall, entitled “A
Contribution towards the Study of the Scandinavian element in the
English Dialects,” printed in the German periodical entitled
<i>Anglia, Neue Folge</i>, Band <span class = "smallcaps">viii</span>, 1897.</p>

<p>I now give a list, a mere selection, of some of the more remarkable
words of Scandinavian origin that are known to our dialects. For their
various uses and localities, see the <i>English Dialect
Dictionary</i>; and for their etymologies, see my Index to Cleasby and
Vigfusson. Many of these words are well approved and forcible, and may
perhaps be employed hereafter to reinforce our literary language.</p>

<p>Another source of foreign supply to the vocabulary of the dialects is
French; a circumstance which seems hitherto to have been almost
entirely ignored. The opinion has, I think, been expressed more than
once, that dialects are almost, if not altogether, free from French
influence. Some, however, have called attention, perhaps too much
attention, to the French words found in Lowland Scotch; and it is
common to adduce always the same set of examples, such as
<i>ashet</i>, a dish (F. <i>assiette</i>, a trencher, plate:
Cotgrave), <i>gigot</i>, a leg of mutton, and <i>petticoat-tails</i>,
certain cakes baked with butter (ingeniously altered from <i>petits
gastels</i>, old form of <i>petits gâteaux</i>), by way of
illustration. Indeed, a whole book has been written on this subject;
see <i>A Critical Enquiry into the Scottish Language</i>, by
Francisque-Michel, 4to, Edinburgh, 1882. But the importance of the
borrowings,
<a name = "page94"> </a><span class = "pagenum">94</span>
chiefly in Scotland, from Parisian French, has been
much exaggerated, as in the work just mentioned; and a far more
important source has been ignored, viz. Anglo-French, which I here
propose to consider.</p>

<p>By Anglo-French is meant the highly important form of French which is
largely peculiar to England, and is of the highest value to the
philologist. The earliest forms of it were Norman, but it was
afterwards supplemented by words borrowed from other French dialects,
such as those of Anjou and Poitou, as well as from the Central French
of Paris. It was thus developed in a way of its own, and must always
be considered, in preference to Old Continental French, when English
etymologies are in question. It is true that it came to an end about
1400, when it ceased to be spoken; but at an earlier date it was alive
and vigorous, and coined its own peculiar forms. A very simple example
is our word <i>duty</i>, which certainly was not borrowed from the Old
French <i>devoir</i>, but from the Anglo-French <i>duetee</i>, a word
familiar in Old London, but absolutely unknown to every form of
continental French.</p>

<p>The point which I have here to insist upon is that not only does our
literary language abound with Anglo-French words, but that they are
also common enough in our dialects; a point which, as far as I know,
is almost invariably overlooked. Neither have our dialects escaped the
influence of the Central
<a name = "page95"> </a><span class = "pagenum">95</span>
French of Paris, and it would have
been strange if they had; for the number of French words in English is
really very large. It is not always possible to discriminate between
the Old French of France and of England, and I shall here consider
both sources together, though the Old Norman words can often be easily
discerned by any one who is familiar with the Norman peculiarities. Of
such peculiarities I will instance three, by way of example. Thus
Anglo-French often employs <i>ei</i> or <i>ey</i> where Old French
(i.e. of the continent) has <i>oi</i> or <i>oy</i>; and English has
retained the old pronunciations of <i>ch</i> and <i>j</i>. Hence,
whilst <i>convoy</i> is borrowed from French, <i>convey</i> is Anglo-French.
<i>Machine</i> is French, because the <i>ch</i> is pronounced
as <i>sh</i>; but <i>chine</i>, the backbone, is Anglo-French.
<i>Rouge</i> is French, because of the peculiar pronunciation of the
final <i>ge</i>; but <i>rage</i> is Anglo-French; and <i>jaundice</i>
is Anglo-French, as it has the old <i>j</i>. See Chapters
<span class = "smallcaps">iii-vi</span> of my
<i>Principles of English Etymology, Second Series</i>.</p>

<p>A good example of a dialect word is <i>gantry</i> or <i>gauntree</i>,
a wooden stand for barrels, known in varying forms in many dialects.
It is rightly derived, in the <i>E.D.D.</i>, from <i>gantier</i>,
which must have been an A.F. (Anglo-French) form, though now only
preserved in the Rouchi dialect, spoken on the borders of France and
Belgium, and nearly allied to Norman; in fact, M. Hécart, the author
of the <i>Dictionnaire</i>
<a name = "page96"> </a><span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<i>Rouchi-Français</i>, says he had
heard the word in Normandy, and he gives a quotation for it from
Olivier Basselin, a poet who lived in Normandy at the beginning of the
fifteenth century. The Parisian form is <i>chantier</i>, which
Cotgrave explains as “a Gauntrey... for hogs-heads to stand on.” Here
is a clear example of a word which is of Norman, or A.F., origin; and
there must be many more such of which the A.F. form is lost. There is
no greater literary disgrace to England than the fact that there is no
reasonable Dictionary in existence of Anglo-French, though it contains
hundreds of highly important legal terms. It ought, in fact, to have
been compiled before either the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> or
the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, both of which have suffered from
the lack of it.</p>

<p>It would indeed be tedious to enumerate the vast number of French
words in our dialects. Many are literary words used in a peculiar
sense, often in one that has otherwise been long obsolete; such as
<i>able</i>, rich; <i>access</i>, an ague-fit; <i>according</i>,
comparatively; <i>to act</i>, to show off, be ridiculous;
<i>afraid</i>, conj., for fear that; <i>agreeable</i>, willing;
<i>aim</i>, to intend; <i>aisle</i>, a central thoroughfare in a shop,
etc.; <i>alley</i>, the aisle of a church; <i>allow</i>, to suppose;
<i>anatomy</i>, a skeleton; <i>ancient</i>, an ensign, flag;
<i>anguish</i>, inflammation; <i>annoyance</i>, damage;
<i>anointed</i>, notoriously vicious; <i>apron</i>, the diaphragm of
an animal; <i>apt</i>, sure; <i>arbitrary</i>,
<a name = "page97"> </a><span class = "pagenum">97</span>
impatient of
restraint; <i>archangel</i>, dead nettle; <i>argue</i>, to signify;
<i>arrant</i>, downright; <i>auction</i>, an untidy place, a crowd;
<i>avise</i> (for <i>advise</i>), to inform. It is needless to go
through the rest of the alphabet.</p>

<p>Moreover, dialect-speakers are quite capable of devising new forms for
themselves. It is sufficient to instance <i>abundation</i>, abundance;
<i>ablins</i>, possibly (made from <i>able</i>); <i>argle</i>,
<i>argie-bargie</i>, <i>argle-bargle</i>, <i>argufy</i>, all varieties
of the verb <i>to argue</i>; and so on.</p>

<p>The most interesting words are those that have survived from Middle
English or from Tudor English times. Examples are <i>aigre</i>, sour,
tart, which is Shakespeare’s <i>eagre</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>,
<span class = "smallcaps">i</span>, v 69;
<i>ambry</i>, <i>aumbry</i>, cupboard, spelt <i>almarie</i> in
<i>Piers the Plowman</i>, B <span class = "smallcaps">xiv</span> 246;
<i>arain</i>, a spider, spelt
<i>yreyn</i> in Wyclif’s translation of Psalm
<span class = "smallcaps">xc</span> 10, which, after all,
is less correct; <i>arles</i>, money paid on striking a bargain, a
highly interesting word, spelt <i>erles</i> in the former half of the
thirteenth century; <i>arris</i>, the angular edge of a cut block of
stone, etc., from the O.F. <i>areste</i>, L. <i>arista</i>, which has
been revived by our Swiss mountain-climbers in the form <i>aréte</i>;
<i>a-sew</i>, dry, said of cows that give no milk (cf. F.
<i>essuyer</i>, to dry); <i>assoilyie</i>, to absolve, acquit, and
<i>assith</i>, to compensate, both used by Sir W. Scott; <i>astre</i>,
<i>aistre</i>, a hearth, a Norman word found in 1292; <i>aunsel</i>, a
steelyard, of which the etymology is given in the <i>E.D.D.</i>;
<i>aunter</i>, an adventure, from the A.F. <i>aventure</i>;
<i>aver</i>,
<a name = "page98"> </a><span class = "pagenum">98</span>
a beast of burden, horse, used by Burns, from the
A.F. <i>aveir</i>, property, cattle; <i>averous</i>, A.F.
<i>averous</i>, avaricious, in Wyclif’s translation of 1 Cor. vi 10.</p>

<p>Here is ample proof of the survival of Anglo-French in our dialects.
Indeed, their chief philological use consists in the great antiquity
of many of the terms, which often preserve Old English and Anglo-French
forms with much fidelity. The charge often brought against
dialect speakers of using “corrupt” forms is only occasionally and
exceptionally true. Much worse “corruptions” have been made by
antiquaries, in order to suit their false etymologies.</p>

<h2>LATER HISTORY OF THE DIALECTS</h2>

<p>With the ascendancy of East Midland, and its acceptance as the chief
literary language, the other dialects practically ceased to be
recorded, with the exception (noted above) of the Scottish
Northumbrian. Of English Northumbrian, the sixteenth century tells us
nothing beyond what we can glean from belated copies of Northern
ballads or such traces of a Northern (apparently a Lancashire) dialect
as appear in Spenser’s <i>Shepherd’s Calendar</i>. Fitzherbert’s
<i>Boke of Husbandry</i> (1534) was reprinted for the E.D.S. in 1882.
It was written, not by Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, as I erroneously said
in the Preface, but by his brother, John Fitzherbert, as has been
subsequently shown. It contains a considerable number of dialectal
words. Thomas Tusser (1525-1580), born in Essex, wrote <i>A Hundreth
Good Pointes of Husbandrie</i> (1557), and <i>Fiue Hundred Pointes of
Good Husbandrie</i> (1573); see the edition by Payne and Herrtage,
E.D.S., 1878. He employs many country
<a name = "page100"> </a><span class = "pagenum">100</span>
words, presumably Essex.
The dialect assumed by Edgar in Shakespeare’s <i>King Lear</i> is not
to be taken as being very accurate; he talks somewhat like a
Somersetshire peasant, but I suppose his speech to be in a
conventional stage dialect, such as we find also in <i>The London
Prodigall</i>, Act <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>, Sc. 4,
where Olyver, “a Devonshire Clothier,”
uses similar expressions, viz. <i>chill</i> for <i>Ich will</i>, I
will; and <i>chy vor thee</i>, I warn thee.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the value of dialectal
words as helping to explain our English vocabulary began to be
recognised. Particular mention may be made of the <i>Etymologicon
Linguæ Anglicanæ</i>, by Stephen Skinner, London, 1671; and it should
be noted that this is the Dictionary upon which Dr Johnson relied for
the etymology of native English words. At the same time, we must not
forget to note two Dictionaries of a much earlier date, which are of
high value. The former of these is the <i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>,
completed in 1440, published by the Camden Society in 1865; which
contains a rather large proportion of East Anglian words. The second
is the <i>Catholicon Anglicum</i>, dated 1483, ed. S.J. Herrtage,
E.E.T.S., 1881, which is distinctly Northern (possibly of Yorkshire
origin).</p>

<p>We find in Skinner occasional mention of Lincolnshire words, with
which he was evidently familiar. Examples are: <i>boggle-boe</i>, a
spectre; <i>bratt</i>, an apron;
<a name = "page101"> </a><span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<i>buffet-stool</i>, a
hassock; <i>bulkar</i>, explained by Peacock as “a wooden hutch in a
workshop or a ship.”</p>

<p>The study of modern English Dialects began with the year 1674, when
the celebrated John Ray, Fellow of the Royal Society, botanist,
zoologist, and collector of local words and proverbs, issued his
<i>Collection of English Words not generally used</i>; of which a
second edition appeared in 1691. See my reprint of these; E.D.S.,
1874. This was the first general collection, and one of the best; and
after this date (1674) many dialect words appeared in English
Dictionaries, such as those of Elisha Coles (1676, and four subsequent
editions); John Kersey (1708, etc.); Nathaniel Bailey (1721, etc.); N.
Bailey’s <i>Dictionary</i>, Part <span class = "smallcaps">ii</span>,
a distinct work (1727, etc.). The
celebrated <i>Dictionary</i> by Dr Johnson, 2 vols., folio, London,
1755, owed much to Bailey. Later, we may notice the <i>Dictionary</i>
by John Ash, London, 1775; and Todd’s edition of Johnson, London,
1818. It is needless to mention later works; see the Complete List of
Dictionaries, by H.B. Wheatley, reprinted in the E.D.S.
Bibliographical List (1877), pp. 3-11; and the long List of Works
which more particularly relate to English Dialects in the same, pp.
11-17. Among the latter may be mentioned <i>A Provincial Glossary</i>,
by F. Grose, London, 1787, second edition 1790; <i>Supplement to the
same</i>, by the late S. Pegge, F.S.A., London, 1814; and <i>Glossary
of Archaic and Provincial</i>
<a name = "page102"> </a><span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<i>Words</i>, by the late Rev.
J. Boucher, ed. Hunter and Stevenson, 1832-3. The last of these was
attempted on a large scale, but never got beyond the word
<i>Blade</i>; so that it was practically a failure. The time for
producing a real Dialect Dictionary had not yet come; but the valuable
<i>Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</i>, by J.
Jamieson, published at Edinburgh in 4 vols., 4to, in 1808-25, made an
excellent beginning.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century not only accumulated for our use a rather large
number of general works on Dialects, but also a considerable quantity
of works illustrating them separately. I may instance those on the
dialect of Bedfordshire, by T. Batchelor, 1809; of Berkshire, by Job
Lousley, 1852; Cheshire, by R. Wilbraham, 1820, 1826; East Anglia, by
R. Forby, 1830, and by Nall, 1866; Teesdale, co. Durham, by F.T.
Dinsdale, 1849; Herefordshire, by G.C. Lewis, 1839; Lincolnshire, by
J.E. Brogden, 1866; Northamptonshire, by Miss A.E. Baker, 2 vols.,
1854; the North Country, by J.T. Brockett, 1825, 1846; Somersetshire,
by J. Jennings, 1825, 1869; Suffolk, by E. Moor, 1823; Sussex, by W.D.
Cooper, 1836, 1853; Wiltshire, by J.Y. Akerman, 1842; the Cleveland
dialect (Yorks.), by J.C. Atkinson, 1868; the Craven dialect, by W.
Carr, 1824; and many more of the older type that are still of value.
We have also two fairly good general dictionaries of dialect words;
that
<a name = "page103"> </a><span class = "pagenum">103</span>
by T. Wright, 1857, 1869; and that by J.O. Halliwell, 2
vols., 1847, 11th ed., 1889. See the exhaustive Bibliographical List
of all works connected with our dialects in the <i>E.D.D.</i>,
pp. 1-59, at the end of vol. <span class = "smallcaps">vi</span>.</p>

<p>In 1869 appeared Part I of Dr A.J. Ellis’s great work on <i>Early
English Pronunciation</i>, with especial reference to Shakespeare and
Chaucer; followed by Part II of the same, on the Pronunciation of the
thirteenth and previous centuries, of Anglo-Saxon, Icelandic, Old
Norse, and Gothic. In 1871 appeared Part III of the same, on the
Pronunciation of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. Part IV was
then planned to include the Pronunciation of the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, including the Phonology of the
Dialects; and for this purpose it was necessary to gain particulars
such as could hardly be accomplished without special research. It was
partly with this in view, and partly in order to collect material for
a really comprehensive dictionary, that, in 1873, I founded the
English Dialect Society, undertaking the duties of Secretary and
Director. The Society was brought to an end in 1896, after producing
80 publications and collecting much material. Mr Nodal, of Manchester,
was Secretary from 1876 to 1893; and from 1893 to 1896 the
headquarters of the Society were in Oxford. Besides this, I raised a
fund in 1886 for collecting additional material in manuscript, and
thus obtained
<a name = "page104"> </a><span class = "pagenum">104</span>
a considerable quantity, which the Rev. A.
Smythe Palmer, D.D., in the course of two years and a half, arranged
in fair order. But even in 1889 more was required, and the work was
then taken in hand by Dr Joseph Wright, who gives the whole account of
the means by which, in 1898, he was enabled to issue Vol.
<span class = "smallcaps">i</span> of the
<i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>. The sixth and concluding volume of
this most valuable work was issued in 1905.</p>

<p>To this I refer the reader for all further information, which is there
given in a very complete form. At the beginning is a Preface
explaining the history of the book; followed by lists of voluntary
readers, of unprinted MS. collections, and of correspondents
consulted; whilst Vol. <span class = "smallcaps">vi</span>,
besides a Supplement of 179 pages, gives a
Bibliography of Books and MSS. quoted, with a full Index; to which is
added the <i>English Dialect Grammar</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>English Dialect Grammar</i> was also published, in 1905, as a
separate work, and contains a full account of the phonology of all the
chief dialects, the very variable pronunciation of a large number of
leading words being accurately indicated by the use of a special set
of symbols; the Table of Vowel-sounds is given at p. 13. The Phonology
is followed by an Accidence, which discusses the peculiarities of
dialect grammar. Next follows a rather large collection of important
words, that are differently
<a name = "page105"> </a><span class = "pagenum">105</span>
pronounced in different counties;
for example, more than thirty variations are recorded of the
pronunciation of the word <i>house</i>. The fulness of the Vocabulary
in the Dictionary, and the minuteness of the account of the phonology
and accidence in the Grammar, leave nothing to desire. Certainly no
other country can give so good an account of its Dialects.</p>

<h2>THE MODERN DIALECTS</h2>

<p>It has been shown that, in the earliest period, we can distinguish
three well-marked dialects besides the Kentish, viz. Northumbrian,
Mercian, and Anglo-Saxon; and these, in the Middle English period, are
known as Northern, Midland, and Southern. The modern dialects are very
numerous, but can be arranged under five divisions, two of which may
be called Northern and Southern, as before; whilst the other three
arise from a division of the widely spread Midland into subdivisions.
These may be called, respectively, West Midland, Mid Midland (or
simply Midland), and East Midland; and it has been shown that similar
subdivisions appear even in the Middle English period.</p>

<p>This arrangement of the modern dialects under five divisions is that
adopted by Prof. Wright, who further simplifies the names by using
Western in place of West Midland, and Eastern in place of East
<a name = "page107"> </a><span class = "pagenum">107</span>

Midland. This gives us, as a final result, five divisions of English
dialects, viz. Northern, Western, Midland, Eastern, and Southern; to
which we must add the dialects of modern Scotland (originally
Northern), and the dialects of Ireland, viz. of Ulster (a kind of
Northern), Dublin, and Wexford (a kind of Southern).</p>

<p>No map of dialects is here given in illustration, because it is
practically impossible to define their boundaries accurately. Such a
map was once given by Dr Ellis, but it is only arbitrary; and Prof.
Wright expressly says that, in his work also, the boundaries suggested
are inexact; they are only given for convenience, as an approximation
to the truth. He agrees with Dr Ellis in most of the particulars.</p>

<p>Many of the counties are divided between two, or even three, dialects;
I somewhat simplify matters by omitting to mention some of them, so as
to give merely a general idea of the chief dialectal localities. For
fuller information, see the <i>Dialect Grammar</i>.</p>

<h2>A FEW SPECIMENS</h2>

<p>There is a great wealth of modern dialect literature, as indicated by
the lists in the <i>E.D.D.</i> Some of these dialect books are poor
and inaccurate, and they are frequently spelt according to no
intelligible phonetic principles. Yet it not unfrequently happens, as
in the works of Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens, that the
dialectal scraps indicate the pronunciation with tolerable fidelity,
which is more than can be said of such portions of their works as are
given in the normal spelling. It is curious to notice that writers in
dialect are usually, from a phonetic point of view, more careful and
consistent in their modes of indicating sounds than are the rest of
us. Sometimes their spelling is, accordingly, very good. Those who are
interested in this subject may follow up this hint with advantage.</p>

<p>It is impossible to mention even a tithe of the names of our better
dialect writers. In Scotland alone there is a large number, some of
the more
<a name = "page111"> </a><span class = "pagenum">111</span>
recent bearing such well-known names as those of R.L.
Stevenson, George Macdonald (Aberdeen), J.M. Barrie (Forfarshire), and
S.R. Crockett (Galloway). Dean Ramsay’s humorous <i>Reminiscences of
Scottish Life and Character</i> must not be passed over. For Ireland
we have William Carleton’s <i>Traits and Stories of the Irish
Peasantry</i>, and the novels by Lever and Lover. Cumberland has its
delightful stories of <i>Joe and the Geologist</i>, and <i>Bobby
Banks’ Bodderment</i>. Cornwall has its <i>Tales</i>, by J.T.
Tregellas. Devon can boast of R.D. Blackmore, Dorset of Hardy and
Barnes, and Lincoln of Tennyson. The literature of Lancashire is vast;
it suffices to mention John Collier (otherwise Tim Bobbin), author of
<i>Tummus and Meary</i>, Ben Brierley, John Byrom, J.P. Morris, author
of <i>T’ Lebby Beck Dobby</i>, and Edwin Waugh, prose author and poet.
<i>Giles’s Trip to London</i>, and the other sketches by the same
author, are highly characteristic of Norfolk. Northamptonshire has its
poet, John Clare; and Suffolk can boast of Robert Bloomfield.
According to her own statement, printed in the Preface (p. viii) to
the E.D.S. <i>Bibliographical List</i>, George Eliot, when writing
<i>Adam Bede</i>, had in mind “the talk of N. Staffordshire and the
neighbouring part of Derbyshire”; whilst, in <i>Silas Marner</i>, “the
district imagined is in N. Warwickshire.” Southey wrote <i>T’ Terrible
Knitters e’ Dent</i> in the Westmoreland
<a name = "page112"> </a><span class = "pagenum">112</span>
dialect. Yorkshire,
like Lancashire, has a large literature, to which the <i>E.D.D.</i>
Booklist can alone do justice.</p>

<p>The following extract is from Chapter
<span class = "smallcaps">xviii</span> of <i>Johnny Gibb of

1908. One special peculiarity of the dialect is the use of <i>f</i>

describes how the speaker and his friends went to hear a bellman make
a proclamation about the appointment of a new minister to a church.</p>

<p>The following extract is from a remarkable tract entitled <i>A Bran
New Wark, by William De Worfat</i>; Kendal, 1785. The author was the
Rev. William Hutton, Rector of Beetham in Westmoreland, 1762-1811, and
head of a family seated at Overthwaite (here called Worfat) in that
parish. It was edited by me for the E.D.S. in 1879.</p>

<blockquote>
Last Saturday sennet, abaut seun in the evening (twas lownd and fraaze
hard) the stars twinkled, and the setting moon cast gigantic shadows.
I was stalking hameward across Blackwater-mosses, and whistling as I
tramp’d for want of thought, when a noise struck my ear, like the
crumpling of frosty murgeon; it made me stop short, and I thought I
saw a strange form before me: it vanished behint a windraw; and again
thare was nought in view but dreary dykes, and dusky ling. An awful
silence reigned araund; this was sean brokken by a skirling hullet;
sure nivver did hullet, herrensue, or miredrum, mak sic a noise
before. Your minister [<i>himself</i>] was freetned, the hairs of his
head stood an end, his blead storkened, and the haggard creature
moving slawly nearer, the mirkiness of the neet shew’d her as big
again as she was... She stoup’d and drop’d a poak, and thus began with
a whining tone. “Deary me! deary me! forgive me, good Sir, but this
yance, I’ll steal naa maar. This seek is elding to keep us fra
starving!”... [<i>The author visits the poor woman’s cottage</i>.] She
sat on a three-legg’d steal, and a dim coal smook’d within the rim of
a brandreth, oor which a seety rattencreak hung dangling fra a black
randletree. The walls were plaister’d with dirt, and a stee, with
hardly a rung, was rear’d into a loft. Araund the woman her lile ans
sprawl’d on the hearth, some whiting speals, some snottering and
crying, and ya ruddy-cheek’d lad threw on a

loww, for its mother to find her loup. By this sweal I beheld this

<p>The following extract from “A Norfolk Dialogue” is from a work
entitled <i>Erratics by a Sailor</i>, printed anonymously at London in
1800, and written by the Rev. Joshua Larwood, rector of Swanton
Morley, near East Dereham. Most of the words are quite familiar to me,
as I was curate of East Dereham in 1861-2, and heard the dialect
daily. The whole dialogue was reprinted in <i>Nine Specimens of
English Dialects</i>; E.D.S., 1895.</p>

<p>The Dialogue was accompanied by “a translation,” as here reprinted. It
renders a glossary needless.</p>

his weeson, and huckle-bone. There was northing but cadders in the
douw-pollar, and no douws: and so, arter she had barnt the balk, and

snatched the poker from the back of the stove, and flung it

There were no pigeons in the pigeon-house, and nothing but
jack-daws; and so, after she had burned the beam, and the
door-frame and the floor, she ran into the cowyard, through the
small field, and fainted behind several pitchers of yeast.

Pulverbatch, rescued her little son, who had fallen into the brook.</p>

<h3><a name = "South3">Southern (Group 3): Isle of Wight.</a></h3>

<p>The following colloquy is quoted in the <i>Glossary of Isle of Wight
Words</i>, E.D.S., 1881, at p. 50.</p>

<blockquote>
I recollect perfectly the late Mr James Phillips of Merston relating a
dialogue that occurred between two of his labourers relative to the
word <i>straddle-bob</i>, a beetle.... At the time of luncheon, one of
them, on taking his <i>bren-cheese</i> (bread and cheese) out of a
little bag, saw something that had found its way there; which led to
the following discourse.<br>
<br>
<i>Jan.</i> What’s got there, you?<br>
<br>
<i>Will.</i> A straddlebob craalun about in the nammut-bag.<br>
<br>
<i>J.</i> Straddlebob? Where ded’st leyarn to caal ’n by that neyam?<br>
<br>
<i>W.</i> Why, what shoud e caal ’n? ’Tes the right neyam, esn ut?<br>
<br>
<i>J.</i> Right neyam? No! Why, ye gurt zote vool, casn’t zee ’tes a
dumbledore?<br>
<br>
<i>W.</i> I know ’tes; but vur aal that, straddlebob’s zo right a
neyam vor ’n as dumbledore ez.

<i>J.</i> Come, I’ll be blamed if I doant laay thee a quart o’ that.<br>
<br>
<i>W.</i> Done! and I’ll ax Meyastur to-night when I goos whoam, bee’t
how’t wool.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, Meyastur was applied to by Will, who made his decision
known to Jan the next morning.<br>
<br>
<i>W.</i> I zay, Jan! I axed Meyastur about that are last night.<br>
<br>
<i>J.</i> Well, what ded ur zay?<br>

<h3><a name = "South7">Southern (Group 7): East Sussex.</a></h3>

<p>The following quotations are from the <i>Dictionary of the Sussex
Dialect</i>, by the Rev. W.D. Parish, Vicar of Selmeston; E.D.S. 1875.
The Glossary refers rather to E. than to W. Sussex, Selmeston being
between Lewes and Eastbourne.</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Call over</i>, to abuse. “He come along here a-cadging, and fancy
he just did call me over, because I told him as I hadn’t got naun to
give him.” (<i>Naun</i>, nothing.)<br>
<br>
<i>Clocksmith</i>, a watchmaker. “I be quite lost about time, I be;
for I’ve been forced to send my watch to the clocksmith. I
<a name = "page131"> </a><span class = "pagenum">131</span>
couldn’t make no sense of mending it myself; for I’d iled it and I’d
biled it, and then I couldn’t do more with it.”<br>
<br>
<i>Cocker-up</i>, to spoil; to gloss over with an air of truth. “You
see this here chap of hers, he’s cockered-up some story about having
to goo away somewheres up into the sheeres; and I tell her she’s no
call to be so cluck over it; and for my part I dunno but what I be
very glad an’t, for he was a chap as was always a-cokeing about the
cupboards, and cogging her out of a Sunday.” (<i>The sheeres</i>, any
shire of England except Kent and Sussex; <i>call</i>, reason;
<i>cluck</i>, out of spirits; <i>coke</i>, to peep; <i>cog</i>, to
entice.)<br>
<br>
<i>Joy</i>, a jay. “Poor old Master Crockham, he’s in terrible order,
surelý! The meece have taken his peas, and the joys have got at his
beans, and the snags have spilt all his lettuce.” (<i>Order</i>, bad
temper; <i>meece</i>, mice; <i>snags</i>, snails; <i>spilt</i>,
spoilt.)<br>
<br>
<i>Kiddle</i>, to tickle. “Those thunder-bugs did kiddle me so that I
couldn’t keep still no hows.” (<i>Thunder-bug</i>, a midge.)<br>
<br>
<i>Lawyer</i>, a long bramble full of thorns, so called because, “when
once they gets a holt an ye, ye doänt easy get shut of ’em.”<br>
<br>
<i>Leetle</i>, a diminutive of little. “I never see one of these here
gurt men there’s s’much talk about in the peapers, only once, and that
was up at Smiffle Show adunnamany years agoo. Prime minister, they
told me he was, up at London; a leetle, lear, miserable, skinny-
looking chap as ever I see. ‘Why,’ I says, ‘we doänt count our
minister to be much, but he’s a deal primer-looking than what yourn
be.’” (<i>Gurt</i>, great; <i>Smiffle</i>, Smithfield;
<i>adunnamany</i>, I don’t know how many; <i>lear</i>, thin, hungry;
<i>see</i>, saw.)<br>
<br>
<i>Sarment</i>, a sermon. “I likes a good long sarment, I doos; so as
when you wakes up it ain’t all over.”<br>
<br>
<i>Tempory</i> (temporary), slight, badly finished. “Who be I? Why, I
be John Carbury, that’s who I be! And who be you? Why, you ain’t a man
at all, you ain’t! You be naun but a poor tempory creetur run up by
contract, that’s what you be!”
</blockquote>

<a name = "page132"> </a><span class = "pagenum">132</span>

<blockquote>
<i>Tot</i>, a bush; a tuft of
grass. “There warn’t any grass at all when we fust come here; naun but
a passel o’ gurt old tots and tussicks. You see there was one of these
here new-fashioned men had had the farm, and he’d properly starved the
land and the labourers, and the cattle and everything, without it was
hisself.” (<i>Passel</i>, parcel; <i>tussicks</i>, tufts of rank
grass.)<br>
<br>
<i>Twort</i> (for <i>thwart</i>), pert and saucy. “She’s terrible
twort&mdash;she wants a good setting down, she do; and she’ll get it too.
Wait till my master comes in!”<br>
<br>
<i>Winterpicks</i>, blackthorn berries.<br>
<br>
<i>Winter-proud</i>, cold. “When you sees so many of these here
winterpicks about, you may be pretty sure ’twill be middlin’ winter-
proud.”

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
